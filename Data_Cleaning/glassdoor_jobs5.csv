Please indicate whether or not your graduate program and internship are accredited by APA or COAMFTE or CSWE
This is a telehealth position so you can work from anywhere as long as you are licensed in CA or NY.
Couples Learn is a growing online private practice based in Los Angeles, CA providing online couples and individual therapy in the area of love and relationships. We provide online sessions through a secure video chat service to high functioning, well educated, professional clients. Our clientele consists of approximately 70% couples and 30% individuals. Our typical couples therapy client is between the ages of 25-45, has been in their relationship 10 years or less, and is on the verge of breaking up due to repeated fighting and disconnection in their relationship. Our typical individual therapy client has experienced attachment wounding and relationship trauma and needs help understanding and healing this to have successful relationships.
The Ideal Candidate: *
The ideal candidate is an excellent Licensed Psychologist, LMFT, or LCSW who is passionate about love & relationships, experienced in working with couples and individuals with attachment wounding, and wants the flexibility and rewards of working from home in a private practice without the stress of startup, marketing, and administrative costs.
*You are well trained. *You come from an accredited graduate program, are committed to continuing education and have excellent references.
*You are committed to your own personal growth *and doing your inner work – inside and outside of this position.
*You’re confident.* You’re not only confident in your worth as a human, but you’re also confident in your skillset as a couples therapist. Our high-functioning, professional clients are looking for guidance and leadership. You must embody the qualities our clients want to learn and project confidence without ego.
*You’re humble.* You recognize that feedback is important for growth and you don’t take it personally. You take what serves you and leave what doesn’t fit. You recognize that everyone has something to teach you and you don’t have an ego or shame about asking for help or guidance.
*You’re an A-player and a team player.* As an A-player, you show up excited to learn, serve, and grow every day because you are part of something in service to others. You take responsibility to get it done well, whether anyone is watching you or not. As a team-player, you are thrilled to work alongside other A-players on our team dedicated to the mission of helping individuals and couples thrive in relationships.
*You show integrity.* You must have absolute integrity, honesty and transparency and be willing to protect both our Intellectual Property and our clients’ confidentiality. You follow-through by keeping your word and doing what you say you’ll do, when you say you will do it.

*You are organized. *You have a system to keep yourself organized and accountable and do not require micro-managing or constant follow-up after a task has been delegated to you. You set deadlines for yourself with reminders to ensure they are met. You use a calendar and have systems that already work for you.
*You want to stay long-term.* If you are trying to create an income while you build your own private practice or want to use this as a building block to creating your own practice, this is not a fit. We really want someone who desires to be a dedicated part of our growing company at least for the next several years.
*You can afford to build slowly. *Building a full caseload in private practice takes time and you are paid by the client hour. Thus, someone who is financially able to support themselves as we build your caseload to 20+ clients per week over the course of 3-9 months is ideal.
Professional & Technical Qualifications: *

(If you have not completed any such training, you must be willing to do so, at your own cost, before starting.)
Comfortable with technology - 100% of our sessions are provided via video chat so you must be comfortable working on Zoom. All scheduling is done online, all records are kept on an electronic medical records system, and all billing is done electronically.
Has or is willing to purchase updated technology (laptop from 2018 or later with a built-in webcam and high-quality headphones with a mic) to provide a seamless client experience. Working from a phone or tablet is not an option.
Has a quiet, private place with a high-speed internet connection to work from with a nice looking, professional background.
Wants to eventually see 20+ clients per week but is ok with building up to that over the course of 3-9 months.
Is able to work 2 evenings until 8pm or 2 early mornings starting at 7am plus one weekend half day (4hrs) as part of your regular schedule. The weekend requirement is somewhat flexible if willing to add more evening hours during the week.
Responsibilities: *

You get to do minimal admin work while making a comfortable income so you have time to enjoy your family, hobbies, travel - whatever brings quality and meaning to your life!
*Community: *While we may not have an office where you can chat with colleagues in between sessions, we are a team and we value connection. We meet as a team regularly via video chat and sometimes even in person if you’re in the Los Angeles area.
*Innovation: *You get to be part of an exciting, growing, cutting-edge and highly impactful private practice which will keep on expanding across the United States while maintaining the highest standards.
*Steady client sourcing: * We will take care of getting you clients through our digital marketing system and providing all the structure needed for a successful practice. You will have an average of 2-5 new client consults per week while we build your caseload (this is a rough estimate and varies depending on the time of year).
*Systems & Training: * Easy to use and efficient systems to run your own online scheduling, billing, super billing, video platform, practice management software, Couples Learn domain email, etc. Training on how to use our systems, how to convert consults to clients, and case consultation with the team as needed.

We Are Cisco


#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Why consider OPI, and why do people dig working here?
Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor.

The goal of the development team is to maximize the financial well-being of the communities we serve through movement building.

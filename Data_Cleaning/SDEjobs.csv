From food to home to news and technology and more, we represent the influential voices who make the internet a better place. As the largest exclusive publisher network, with direct access to code-on-page and underlying datasets, we have a unique capability to build innovative products that span across publishers, advertisers and consumers.

This position can be in-office in New York City or work-from-home. Remote U.S. candidates encouraged to apply.

This Software Engineer role is focused on the development and optimization of systems and tools we use to operate our business. These processes include but are not limited to those used to acquire, onboard, integrate with, manage, and support our customers. Given the broad scope of this effort, a successful candidate must be driven by understanding and improving work processes and developing solutions that potentially use a wide variety of technologies. For example, some solutions may involve extending or developing a web-based application using Angular and node.js, while other solutions may involve the integration of enterprise systems using golang, python, or some other language and technology stack. We are treating this effort as we treat all of our product development efforts, using agile methods to deliver incremental value to the business.

Skills and Experience
While we do not fixate on number of years of experience, we expect it will take at least 5 years doing professional software development on internal tools, enterprise platforms, or similar systems to excel in this role.
Full-stack web development, meaning use of front-end frameworks like Angular, and development of back-end services in node.js, potentially integrating with persistent stores like postgresql.
Experience integrating with enterprise CRM systems like Salesforce.com.
Experience with building and operating software in the public cloud, specifically AWS.
Experience and passion for developing business-critical solutions for an internal user base.
Qualities

Beyond experience in a software engineering role, we focus on the qualities we feel are important to success on our team. These include:
Proactive/Follows through--opportunities for work optimization may not always be fully formed or completely spelled out. You need to take the lead on conceiving solutions and seeing them through to delivery and actual usage.
Communication, especially cross-functionally--you will be working on internal systems used by a variety of people doing very different kinds of work and being adept at communication will be key.
Enjoys improving processes and workflows--this is the essence of this role. More than interest in any specific technology, you must be driven by optimizing work.
Adaptable/Flexible--decisions about where to apply technology are based on ROI calculations, and that could lead to changes in direction as new opportunities are discovered. An agile mindset is key.
Versatile, especially with technologies; a tinkerer--the variety of software you develop could run a wide gamut, so you need to excel at taking on new challenges outside your comfort zone.
Curious, likes to explore alternatives--understanding your users and the work they do should be compelling to you. You want to wear their shoes and think about different ways to tackle their work.
Pragmatic--delivering value quickly and incrementally is favored over longer efforts that defer value delivery. You get things done quickly and learn from experience.
Resourceful--sometimes the best solutions involve leveraging a variety of resources already in play, or researching how others solve similar problems.
Open minded--some problems may seem impossibly challenging, or the solution might not be obvious. Being open minded to explore options is important here.
Driven--your desire to help others and optimize solutions is intrinsic and second nature to you.
CafeMedia is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe we are most impactful when people with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and identities come together with common purpose. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.

We are a team of 15 energetic, fun, and happy customer fanatics at our Managed IT Services company. We enjoy a good laugh and hard work; our goal is to keep our work time at 40hrs per week, be as efficient as possible during that time. Learning is part of our DNA, flexibility enables us to keep nimble.

Please respond to the audio questionnaire. Why? it’s a vital step to learn about your communication skills, as they are required for this role. All candidates have; this is an opportunity to express yourself.

We are looking for a candidate with the right attitude, interest, and people skills. As part of a small agile company, at times, we wear many hats. You should be comfortable meeting with people in the C-suite in the morning talking about company projections, and be under a desk connecting a phone in the afternoon and replacing a firewall at the end of the day. If crawling under a desk or you are too intimidated talking to the CEO or COO, this job is not for you.

For some of you, this position may take you out of your comfort zone; we are okay with that as long as you are fine too. You may need to take some time reviewing group policies, or server logs. This position will challenge you to think out of the box. Your network admin skills will be useful to translate the client’s pain into a project by writing down the scope the team will execute with your guidance. Gaining knowledge of new solutions like PowerApps, will increase the possibilities for solutions. You don’t need to be one anything a solution, for that we have a vCIO, who will review the projects to the client’s CEO; your role to find out the pains/opportunities and create solutions, maybe make a new group policy, install new software or replacing an access point location.

The goal is for your work to be in a proactive versus reactive mode, most of the time. Every now and then, there will be a project requiring you to jump in and help replace a server or router after hours, that should be the exception and not the rule. Therefore, planning will mitigate such situations.

Of course, continual documentation of our client’s environment is critical so our remote support team can resolve tickets faster with the right documentation.

Other requirements: You must be able to lift 50lbs, you may need to replace a server or a small printer.

Required Technical Skills:
Microsoft Windows10 install/support/troubleshooting
Microsoft Office365 install/support/troubleshooting
PC hardware knowledge (replace memory, repairing PCs, replace hard drives, etc.).
Understanding of Local and Wide Area Networking and services

Mavenlink’s product is changing the entire services industry and engineering has a front-row seat. We’re not looking for more people to solve problems, we’re looking for more engineers to develop new features and provide thought leadership! Some of the things we’re working on together include:
Auto-scaled, self-healing production Kubernetes implementation
Developing a rich & sophisticated React component architecture
Evolving from a single Rails app to cohesive, decoupled services

You challenge the old trope of being a loner, you’re looking to be part of a team! It’s tough to grow and develop great ideas when you’re encased in the silo -you’re looking for a place to stretch. Maybe you’re sick of being used to only put out fires, or hate the idea of just being a maintenance engineer. Our culture defeats these by design! A great addition would bring:

528,Software Engineer,-1,"A BIT ABOUT US
Lever was founded eight years ago to tackle the most strategic challenge that companies face: how to recruit and hire top talent. We’re building the next generation of hiring software that companies like Netflix, Cirque du Soleil, Shopify, and Eventbrite rely on to grow their teams. We've rethought the talent acquisition paradigm and are the innovation leaders in our space and looking for the right people to join us as we scale.

We’re extraordinarily proud of the company we’ve built so far (not to mention humbled to be recognized as the #1 place to work in San Francisco, as well as a top workplace in the entire United States). Our people are Lever’s biggest competitive advantage and we’ll continue investing in our “Leveroos” and people-first culture.

THE OPPORTUNITY
As an Engineer on our Product team, you’ll help us build out our core product by developing high-impact, user-facing features. In our growing engineering organization, you’ll be developing and shipping new features and updates to Lever’s product. You’ll be learning about our real-time web stack UI frameworks that help us deliver a beautiful and high quality solution to our customers. You’ll work collaboratively with product managers and designers to drive the implementation and release of major features, and be a champion of best practices for writing well-tested, well-organized code.

You’ll become familiar with all parts of our stack—including our open source web framework, DerbyJS. You will exercise judgment in making tradeoffs between design and feasibility. You’ll engineer your features to be scalable and resilient in a complex, single-page application.

We believe that user-centric design ultimately leads to the best products, so we listen closely to our users, both external and internal. As an engineer on our close-knit, cross-functional team, you’ll be an active voice in shaping our product. Lever is constantly rolling out high-demand features and tackling ever greater challenges of scale.

THE TEAM
You’ll join a team where everyone—including you—is striving to constantly improve their knowledge of infrastructure, systems, and cares about minimizing downtime. We are an incredibly supportive team–we love to pitch in when problems arise and give great peer feedback to help each other grow. We are passionate about lots of things--automation, friendly chat bots, creating a great hiring experience, and a great user experience--and we love sharing those passions with each other.

Read about what our team values and why here.

THE TECH STACK
Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

If this role takes your fancy and you are in interested in a career at Clarabridge please apply here and let's chat - we are always keen to speak to highly talented and passionate people!

The Clarabridge Engage team builds a customer care tool for social media. Our clients use our software to be able to respond to the incoming questions and complaints on their Facebook pages, Twitter accounts, Instagram profiles, a.o. These clients often have a high volume of messages, on several social profiles. We try to make those people's lives easier by offering automation tools, smart routing of messages and reply suggestions, among others.

Engage is one of the products of Clarabridge, and in the broader context of the company we focus on all types of customer feedback (like survey results and call transcriptions), and offer advanced data modelling and dashboarding features. Read on to know more about how we work.

Working at Clarabridge

Within the Engage Development team we try to make Engage as good a product as it can be, by developing features based on customer feedback, and market or product insights from the Product team. These features become projects which one or more people in the team get assigned to, based on their personal interest or knowledge related to those features. Then, the feature is built and tested in an iterative way until we have something that not only works, but that we're proud of too.

Of course, we're totally buzzword-compliant with agile, automated testing, stickies on walls, and coffee breaks.

Requirements

What we look for in people ...
The curiosity and humbleness to second-guess yourself and learn.
The patience to take some time and talk with others and share knowledge.
The courage to take on big projects with loads of responsibility and ownership.
The experience to use proven technologies, tested code, and domain language to everyone's benefit.
The pride to make the best product you possibly can.
The wisdom to leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
All jokes aside, we're looking for great full stack software engineers who are nice to work with on a day to day basis. Our product is a web application, so our main software stack has the usual parts like PHP, MySQL, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, Memcached, Redis, and Node.js. There are some more exotic things in there as well, like Clojure, ReactJS, Vowpal Wabbit, and others. Knowledge of any or all of these technologies is a huge plus, as is experience with high-volume web applications, scalability, and testing.

We use continuous integration and our app is deployed by everyone in the team, multiple times a day. If you know a thing or two about deployment, server management, or monitoring, come talk to us about it! We'd love to hear your opinions.

Cityblock Health is the first tech-driven provider for communities with complex needs, bringing better care to where it's needed most, block by block. Founded in 2017 on the premise that ""health is local"" and based in Brooklyn, we are backed by Alphabet's Sidewalk Labs and some of the top healthcare investors in the country.

Our mission is to improve the health of underserved communities, one block at a time. Importantly, our solutions are designed specifically for Medicaid and lower-income Medicare beneficiaries, and we meet our members where they are—bringing care into the home and neighborhoods through our community-based care teams.

In close collaboration with community-based organizations, local providers, and leading health plans, we are reorganizing the health system to focus on what matters to our members. Equipped with world-class, custom care delivery technology, we deliver personalized primary care, behavioral health, and social services to deliver a radically better experience of care for every member and community we serve.

Over the next year, we'll grow quickly to bring better care to many more members and their communities. We will get started in new markets, each with their own operating structure and care teams, and continue to grow in the communities where we are working already. To do this, we need people who, like us, believe that everyone should have good care for what matters to them, in their community.

Our work is grounded in a belief in the power of a diverse community. To deliver a radically better experience of care to our members and advance equity in the communities we serve, we strive to make our own team diverse and inclusive. Our ways of working are characterized by creativity, collaboration, and mutual learning that comes from bridging together a community from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. We strive to ensure that every person on the Cityblock team, and every Cityblock member, feels like they belong, are valued, respected, and celebrated as a part of our community.

About RMS

There’s a 1% chance an earthquake will cause $50 billion of insured loss within the next 12 months and a 5% chance that a hurricane will cause $60 billion of insured losses next year. At RMS, we turn risks into real numbers. How? By building simulation models that allow insurers and investors to understand and manage their global risks--from hurricanes, quakes, and wildfires, to cyberattacks, terror attacks, and pandemics. Why? We want to build a more resilient world, and we’re on a mission to help make every risk known.

Insurers, reinsurers, investors, financial institutions, governments, and NGOs trust RMS solutions to better understand and manage catastrophe risks. RMS was founded in 1989 by Stanford scientists who created our first model for California Earthquake. Today, RMS has some 1,300 employees across 13 offices in the US, London, Bermuda, Zurich, India, China, Japan, Singapore, and Australia, and over 1,000 products and models now covering six continents.

Exemplifying its depth and versatility in the bridge space, Michael Baker International, ranked Number Five by Engineering News-Record in its annual ranking of Bridge Design Firms in the United States, has partnered with clients on a full spectrum of bridge types-from conventional grade separations to major, complex river crossings, including trusses, arches, box girders and cable-stayed bridges.

DESCRIPTION

Combining a degree in Civil Engineering and knowledge/ education in computer science is an awesome career, but not an easy opportunity path to find. At Michael Baker International, this career is a reality!

We are looking for a Civil Associate I for our Moon Twp., PA location that has 0-2 years' experience ready to work on bridge related software projects .

This is great opportunity with career growth potential and the opportunity to contribute on large cutting-edge projects. The engineer/developer will be part of Michael Baker’s Bridge Software Group. This group has been applying computer technology to the bridge profession for over 30 years, using bridge engineering experience combined with a wide range of programming skills.

The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) contracted with Michael Baker In 1999 to develop a comprehensive bridge software package to guide bridge engineers through the initial design phase of a bridge and to maintain data for analysis and load rating throughout the lifespan of the bridge. The software development has been continuous since then and has been expanded to include nearly all bridge types designed and maintained by member states throughout the nation.

In addition, the software group maintains and enhances software projects for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). These projects include software that designs and drafts simple span steel and prestressed concrete bridges (BRADD3-Bridge Automated Design and Drafting) and a group of analysis/design/rating programs for prestressed concrete beams, steel beams, steel floorbeams, abutments and retaining walls, concrete box culverts, elastomeric bearing pads, and sign structures.

This position will be responsible for utilizing a combination of bridge engineering skills and software development skills to perform tasks on these projects. This position also involves working under the direct supervision of registered Professional Engineers and involves both bridge engineering and software engineering and related skills and often crosses over to work with our bridge design group.

Michael Baker International offers competitive salaries/benefits, a great work environment, the ability to work on high profile projects, significant professional growth potential and the strength and stability that only comes from 80 years of making a difference.

Life as an Ezoic engineer:

Ezoic is an inaugural member of the Google Certified Publishing Partner Program. This means we work closely with Google to help websites optimize their ad revenue. We actually have won awards directly from Google for the artificial intelligence that we've built. Cool, right?!?

Ezoic is a technology-first company. Our CEO is a developer by trade, and our engineers are given all the tools needed to succeed. We empower our engineers to make a lot of their own decisions about both design and implementation, and encourage them to come up with new ideas to improve the application. We also aim to keep a good work-life balance, based on our philosophy that happy engineers are more productive. We want you to be working on something that you are passionate about and allow engineers to move around to keep things fresh.

While we are all working remotely now because of Covid, we have a brand new office in Carlsbad, CA, where we plan to return next year sometimes when the world goes back to normal.

We are part of New Mexico's history - and committed to its future. That is why we will continue to work just as hard and care just as deeply to serve New Mexico for years to come.

About New Mexico

From the Mayflower to the moon landing, every venture relies on insurance. The $1 trillion insurance industry is fundamental to our economy and society, but remains stuck in the stone age. Incumbents rely on antiquated pen-and-paper process and there's a huge opportunity to transform it through technology. At Newfront, we're building software to supercharge insurance brokers and help them deliver a delightful experience to clients.

While we’re a technology-driven company, we believe that people and trusted relationships matter. Newfront believes in empowering people rather than ""disrupting"" them. Our singular mission is to create the future of work for this massive industry.

Clients: We need to design a product that makes their current insurance coverage extremely clear and makes it quick and easy for them to request an update their coverage, get help, or make a claim.
Brokers: We want to help them turn leads into sales. Insurance brokers are like a sales team in a traditional SaaS company. They need a dashboard that clearly communicates the status of all of their clients, tracks their leads, and shows incoming revenue.

Define technical direction: You will help shape the technical vision and roadmap for a large area of the product. You will also influence best practices and introduce new technologies when appropriate.

Requirements
5+ years of engineering experience. You have previous success developing and shipping a large-scale application with a user-empathetic mindset
2+ years of experience leading an engineering team. You have proven abilities in providing technical direction for a small to medium team of engineers.
You're product-minded. You take initiative to understand production intention, team goals, business context, and user problems to propose improvements, eliminate gaps, and reduce risk in the project. You contribute to and drive the teams roadmap with product and design. You meet with stakeholders across the company when needed to eliminate gaps in your knowledge. You work closely with design to make sure that a design is able to be built and that it has a logical system behind it.
Security-minded. You have a detailed understanding of security protocols like OAuth2/OIDC/JWT. You understand client-side cookie authentication and JWT. You should have an understanding of front-end security risks and how to mitigate them.
You're highly skilled with web technologies including JavaScript (React/Node), HTML, and CSS. These are important foundational skills for a front-end engineer and impact everything from performance, to maintainability, to accessibility. You understand which features can be used across the various browsers, you understand how to make a website accessible, and you know how to implement responsive design.
You have experience architecting complex front-end web applications. We use React/Next.js, but you might have experience with Ember or Angular. You understand the concepts of services, stores, state management, build tools, routing, testing, serverless functions, and API design. You might have experience working with micro front-end applications and you are able to discuss trade-offs when slicing up a front-end app. You have created frameworks and libraries to abstract away complexity in your application to amplify your impact across the team.
You have some experience with micro-service/cloud and enterprise architecture patterns. You have an understanding of cloud architecture patterns, like pub-sub and BFF APIs, and are able to work with other engineers to discuss the trade-offs and benefits. While you might not be setting up these systems, you understand how they work, why they're used, and how they can impact front-end app performance, product requirements, and front-end code architecture.
You have a strong understanding of design: You understand that as a front-end engineer it is your job to help uphold the quality of the product. You're aware that loss of quality is often death by a thousand cuts and you care when elements are a few pixels off. You're able to understand why particular interactions should be used and when and you're able to recommend particular UI patterns to solve user problems.

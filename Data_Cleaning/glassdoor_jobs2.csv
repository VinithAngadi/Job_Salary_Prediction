"Software Engineer, Internal Systems",-1,"CafeMedia empowers over 2,800 premium publishers, with a collective reach of over 164MM monthly unique visitors (#12 largest Comscore property in August 2020), to make a living doing what they love producing great content while we manage the advertising for them. From food to home to news and technology and more, we represent the influential voices who make the internet a better place. As the largest exclusive publisher network, with direct access to code-on-page and underlying datasets, we have a unique capability to build innovative products that span across publishers, advertisers and consumers.

This position can be in-office in New York City or work-from-home. Remote U.S. candidates encouraged to apply.

This Software Engineer role is focused on the development and optimization of systems and tools we use to operate our business. These processes include but are not limited to those used to acquire, onboard, integrate with, manage, and support our customers. Given the broad scope of this effort, a successful candidate must be driven by understanding and improving work processes and developing solutions that potentially use a wide variety of technologies. For example, some solutions may involve extending or developing a web-based application using Angular and node.js, while other solutions may involve the integration of enterprise systems using golang, python, or some other language and technology stack. We are treating this effort as we treat all of our product development efforts, using agile methods to deliver incremental value to the business.

Skills and Experience
While we do not fixate on number of years of experience, we expect it will take at least 5 years doing professional software development on internal tools, enterprise platforms, or similar systems to excel in this role.
Full-stack web development, meaning use of front-end frameworks like Angular, and development of back-end services in node.js, potentially integrating with persistent stores like postgresql.
Experience integrating with enterprise CRM systems like Salesforce.com.
Experience with building and operating software in the public cloud, specifically AWS.
Experience and passion for developing business-critical solutions for an internal user base.
Qualities

Beyond experience in a software engineering role, we focus on the qualities we feel are important to success on our team. These include:
Proactive/Follows through--opportunities for work optimization may not always be fully formed or completely spelled out. You need to take the lead on conceiving solutions and seeing them through to delivery and actual usage.
Communication, especially cross-functionally--you will be working on internal systems used by a variety of people doing very different kinds of work and being adept at communication will be key.
Enjoys improving processes and workflows--this is the essence of this role. More than interest in any specific technology, you must be driven by optimizing work.
Adaptable/Flexible--decisions about where to apply technology are based on ROI calculations, and that could lead to changes in direction as new opportunities are discovered. An agile mindset is key.
Versatile, especially with technologies; a tinkerer--the variety of software you develop could run a wide gamut, so you need to excel at taking on new challenges outside your comfort zone.
Curious, likes to explore alternatives--understanding your users and the work they do should be compelling to you. You want to wear their shoes and think about different ways to tackle their work.
Pragmatic--delivering value quickly and incrementally is favored over longer efforts that defer value delivery. You get things done quickly and learn from experience.
Resourceful--sometimes the best solutions involve leveraging a variety of resources already in play, or researching how others solve similar problems.
Open minded--some problems may seem impossibly challenging, or the solution might not be obvious. Being open minded to explore options is important here.
Driven--your desire to help others and optimize solutions is intrinsic and second nature to you.
CafeMedia is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe we are most impactful when people with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and identities come together with common purpose. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.

Our Story…
Western Psychological Services (WPS) was established in 1948 in a little pink house in Brentwood, not far from the local VA hospital. Dr. Morse Manson, the company founder, developed a psychological test that would help returning World War II vets adjust to civilian life. This was the first of many psychological and educational assessments that WPS would publish over subsequent decades. Today these assessments are used by helping professionals throughout the world to evaluate, diagnose, and treat people in need—especially children and teens who have developmental, social, or behavioral challenges. WPS is known world-wide for our industry-leading autism assessments.

That’s the first part of the story: WPS is a stable, successful, family-owned company, 100+ employees strong, engaged in work that you can feel good about doing. This is a place where you can build a career—Many of our employees stick around for 10, 20, or even 30+ years.

Our Latest Chapter…
The second part of our story starts with Jeff Manson, grandson of the founder (and now president of WPS), who’s making a big investment in the company’s future. He’s nurturing a transformative company culture that encourages innovation, creativity, transparency, and collaboration. And, as part of his commitment to a more open work environment, he moved the company a new home in Torrance, with plenty of elbow room, state-of-the-art equipment, and lots of amenities. The idea is that employees who are happy, empowered, acknowledged, and listened to will better serve the customer and the bottom line. It seems to be working—WPS continues to do well year after year!

Full Stack Developer,-1,"We are seeking a motivated Full Stack Developer to join one of our small scrum teams and continue kicking-ass, delivering the sexiest most efficient software known to the government. That’s right, this isn’t your father’s development project, we are building mission critical applications that will shape the future; a future where you have direct impact!

We are truly building the best in breed software, so naturally we are an interesting animal. Our frontend is largely Angular8 and deployed to the web, desktop (via Electron), and mobile (via Cordova). The frontend communicates with backend services though lightweight RESTful API calls to the serviceMesh gateway (Envoy, FreeIPA, NiFi, & HaProxy) which themselves broker requests to an event store (Kafka). Once in Kafka, individual services perform their respective actions in accordance with a pure pub/sub model. Our backend is largely comprised of ’serverless’ microservices, with most being ran on firecracker (AWS Lambda’s engine) and those too large (like Kafka, Elastic Search, etc.) are ran in containers on Kubernetes. Of course, we’ve got some secret sauce here and there, but we are using open standards wherever possible.

The ideal candidate will:
Be eager to learn new technologies and expand their roles and responsibilities.
Excel at translating functional requirements into quality code.
Have a knack for efficiency.
Be familiar with industry best practices and open-source enablers (libraries, tools, tech).
Possess a demonstrable acumen for detail, but not quite debilitating perfectionism.
Be comfortable thinking outside the box and proposing better methods to code/structure the app.
Be comfortable with agile software development (don’t worry, we aren’t a sweat-shop).
Have solid technical understanding and experience with Angular (6+ years).
Be familiar with event-streaming architectures (using Kafka & serviceMeshes).
Be familiar with modularity and microservice architectures.
Have experience creating NodeJS microservices
Each scrum member is both a leader and a follower. As a Senior developer, you will be expected to help mentor more junior developers, but do expect to learn a thing or two yourself.

Some travel may be required on an as needed basis. Eventually, this position may require a government security clearance.

Office hours are flexible with most work performed remotely (as we are a geographically dispersed team) but some actions may require travel and regular team interaction. Most of our team works out of on-trend, workshare office spaces around the nation.

We offer competitive benefits (fully-vested up to 10% 401k matching, 100% company-paid comprehensive healthcare, all 10 federal holidays & 15 days leave, flexible schedules, educational reimbursements, and much more).

Skyward Federal is a small (but growing) startup bringing the best of breed to the most exciting & unique missions possible. We work hard but play harder. There is constant room for growth and cross-training depending on what your life goals are. Apply now & start your journey today!

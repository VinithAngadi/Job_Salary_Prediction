Frontend Lead Software Engineer,-1,"A bit about Newfront:

From the Mayflower to the moon landing, every venture relies on insurance. The $1 trillion insurance industry is fundamental to our economy and society, but remains stuck in the stone age. Incumbents rely on antiquated pen-and-paper process and there's a huge opportunity to transform it through technology. At Newfront, we're building software to supercharge insurance brokers and help them deliver a delightful experience to clients.

While we’re a technology-driven company, we believe that people and trusted relationships matter. Newfront believes in empowering people rather than ""disrupting"" them. Our singular mission is to create the future of work for this massive industry.

We believe breakout growth creates breakout opportunities and diversity drives innovation.

About the role
Newfront is looking for highly skilled engineers to help change the face of insurance by using technology to build incredible, unexpected, and delightful experiences for our clients.
We are looking for people who share our passion and belief that the best technology is simple, beautiful, accessible, and usable.

About the team
We build products for 3 user groups – our clients, brokers, and the servicing team.
Clients: We need to design a product that makes their current insurance coverage extremely clear and makes it quick and easy for them to request an update their coverage, get help, or make a claim.
Brokers: We want to help them turn leads into sales. Insurance brokers are like a sales team in a traditional SaaS company. They need a dashboard that clearly communicates the status of all of their clients, tracks their leads, and shows incoming revenue.
Servicing team: This team includes account managers and operations specialists responsible for providing stellar service to our clients.
What you'll work on
Lead the development of product features: You'll be involved during product discovery and you'll contribute to the technical design process. You are product-minded and able to collaborate with a Product Manager to define the product roadmap and vision. You'll be responsible for speccing and guiding your team in building out features and infrastructure.
Shape business processes: As Newfront is a technology-enabled brokerage, we are looking for new ways to improve business processes by using technology. You will become the expert on how an area of the business functions and work directly with stakeholders to build optimizations.
Define technical direction: You will help shape the technical vision and roadmap for a large area of the product. You will also influence best practices and introduce new technologies when appropriate. You'll need to clearly communicate your vision with the team to gain support and a shared understanding of the technologies.
Mentor other engineers: You will working with more junior engineers on your team to help them grow and develop their skills.
Requirements
5+ years of engineering experience. You have previous success developing and shipping a large-scale application with a user-empathetic mindset
2+ years of experience leading an engineering team. You have proven abilities in providing technical direction for a small to medium team of engineers.
You're product-minded. You take initiative to understand production intention, team goals, business context, and user problems to propose improvements, eliminate gaps, and reduce risk in the project. You contribute to and drive the teams roadmap with product and design. You meet with stakeholders across the company when needed to eliminate gaps in your knowledge. You work closely with design to make sure that a design is able to be built and that it has a logical system behind it.
Security-minded. You have a detailed understanding of security protocols like OAuth2/OIDC/JWT. You understand client-side cookie authentication and JWT. You should have an understanding of front-end security risks and how to mitigate them.
You're highly skilled with web technologies including JavaScript (React/Node), HTML, and CSS. These are important foundational skills for a front-end engineer and impact everything from performance, to maintainability, to accessibility. You understand which features can be used across the various browsers, you understand how to make a website accessible, and you know how to implement responsive design.
You have experience architecting complex front-end web applications. We use React/Next.js, but you might have experience with Ember or Angular. You understand the concepts of services, stores, state management, build tools, routing, testing, serverless functions, and API design. You might have experience working with micro front-end applications and you are able to discuss trade-offs when slicing up a front-end app. You have created frameworks and libraries to abstract away complexity in your application to amplify your impact across the team.
You have some experience with micro-service/cloud and enterprise architecture patterns. You have an understanding of cloud architecture patterns, like pub-sub and BFF APIs, and are able to work with other engineers to discuss the trade-offs and benefits. While you might not be setting up these systems, you understand how they work, why they're used, and how they can impact front-end app performance, product requirements, and front-end code architecture.
You have a strong understanding of design: You understand that as a front-end engineer it is your job to help uphold the quality of the product. You're aware that loss of quality is often death by a thousand cuts and you care when elements are a few pixels off. You're able to understand why particular interactions should be used and when and you're able to recommend particular UI patterns to solve user problems.

Are you an expert at React, Redux, Webpack, browser APIs, ES8, and the rest of today’s modern frontend stack? Do you want to work on a web application used by hundreds of thousands of users?

If so, we’d like you to learn about Files.com!

At Files.com, we’ve invested heavily in the React/Redux platform and are looking to expand our growing team of frontend developers. As a frontend developer at Files.com, you will work on all of our client-facing web applications that are primarily written in Javascript targeting a web browser.

Additionally, you will get the opportunity to work on mobile apps using React Native as well.

About Files.com


Files.com is a cloud storage and file logistics service with over 1,500 paying business customers, including Target, Canonical, UPS, Leica, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.

Our company consists of USA-based remote employees who work from home.

We’re Bootstrapped, Profitable, and Growing


Our success comes from building a great service that solves problems for
our customers, and our growth comes from expanding and
improving our products as quickly as we can.

We believe that great products can only be built by great people.
So we’re on a quest to find the smartest, most creative, and most
motivated people, and create an environment in which
they thrive.

We Are A Remote Company


You will work from home and have some flexibility to choose your
working hours, allowing you to make time for family, recreation,
vacations, or anything that is important to you.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20
days of PTO for vacations. You’ll have the time to take longer
vacations and have fun.

As our employees’ safety is a top priority, and we want to ensure we do not further spread COVID-19, we have paused all company travel. Once it is safe to resume travelling, you’ll travel to in-person meetings with your team and the entire
company to meet and work together face to face. These meetings are in
cities around the US, including Austin, Orlando, New Orleans, San Diego, Las Vegas, and New York City.

We think that these in-person meetings are vital to the success of a
remote team.

About the Role


Our frontend developers are responsible for all client-side code that runs in browsers and mobile apps here at Files.com. We use state-of-the-art tooling, such as React 16, Redux, Redux-Saga, and React Native on the mobile side.

We obsess about testing, code reviews, and keeping production code size low.

Files.com currently has many features that are available in its API that are not available in its frontend UIs, so a considerable part of this job will be building out new features and releasing them to customers as soon as they’re ready.

Here are some example projects that our Frontend Developers have worked on recently or will work on soon:
Rebuilding our internal CRM dashboard in React.
Building a browser-based file uploader that works in all browsers, supports resume, and is able to automatically detect the closest server for uploading.
Building notification panes that show “push notifications” to our users about updates to their files or workflows.
Enhancing our security by adding several new Two-Factor Authentication methods, such as U2F, SMS, and Yubikey.
Minimum Qualifications:


5+ years of applicable experience.
Experience building and delivering React/Redux applications that have seen actual production usage.
Understanding of the language features of ES6 and ES8.
Understanding of common browser APIs and recent extensions to the HTTP protocol as they relate to frontend development.
Understanding of how to write secure frontend code and an awareness of common web application security vulnerabilities.
Testing and the ability to write unit tests/specs (we use popular JavaScript testing frameworks)
Preferred Qualifications:


Experience with at least one major Redux side effect library such as Redux-Thunk, Redux-Saga, Redux-Loop (We use Redux-Saga).
Contributions to major open source projects.
Our Core Beliefs


Here are just some of our Core Beliefs:

We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide
variety of programming language experience. We don’t hire for specific
programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who are
fluent in several programming languages. We want our staff to be
adaptable and ready to evolve to what’s next.

We believe in using the right tool for the job. Our core applications
are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP. We use Rails, React,
Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL,
Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source
systems. We don’t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a
tool just because “that’s how it’s done around here.”

We believe that open-source only works if companies give back. If you
work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at
Files.com, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull
request back to the upstream project. And if you build something from
scratch while working here that’s generic and not related to our core
products, we want you to release that on GitHub too. We’ll also pay
your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.

We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves. We are
our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their
paces every day.

Salary, Pay, and Benefits


Files.com offers industry-leading salaries based on experience combined with unparalleled flexibility and other benefits to secure top talent.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 days of PTO for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.

We will provide you a laptop and a $1,000 signing bonus to purchase a new monitor, desk, or anything else that would help build or refresh your home office.

We’ll update your salary annually based on your performance, as reviewed by your peers.

We fully pay base plan health insurance premiums (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 75% of your spouse or dependents if they wish to join your chosen plan. We want your family to be healthy.

That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new Macbook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultants pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor.

** Role can be remote

What we do:
We are a cloud-native SaaS machine data analytics platform, solving complex monitoring problems for DevOps, SecOps and ITOps teams. Customers love our product because it allows them to easily monitor and optimize their mission critical, large scale applications.

Massive Scale:

Our microservices architecture in AWS ingests hundreds of terabytes daily across many geographic regions. Millions of queries a day analyze hundreds of petabytes of data.

At Sumo Logic, we are building a data platform designed to power the analytics and investigations that are common in the Security Operation Centers of large enterprises. It is designed to accept hundreds of billions of events from security-relevant data sources (detection products, network sensors, log shippers, inventory systems) per day. It is cloud-native, with no plan to support an on-premise deployment. It is multi-tenant, and is designed to simultaneously process events from thousands of our customers. And, it is security-focused — it is designed to perform the kinds of stateful analyses that security analysts demand.

We are building this platform the way startups should — with ruthless prioritization, and with a live and demanding customer base. By joining us as a Senior Frontend Engineer for Cloud SIEM Enterprise, you have the opportunity to make our vision a reality, one feature at a time.

What You Will Be Doing:
Build and maintain beautiful user interfaces for our customers
Work inside of a fast-paced iterative environment
Implementing clean modern designs
Make decisions based on actual client usage
Who You Are:
5+ years experience in a similar role or related technical field
Experience developing web apps with modern UI frameworks (preferably React)
Familiarity with React, TypeScript, Webpack, and Apollo/GraphQL is preferred
You love collecting data about your UI as much as building it to make decisions based on usage
Experience in common UI testing frameworks, including Jest and Cypress
Knowledge of standards and best practices for UX/UI design
Flexibility and willingness to quickly take on new roles and responsibilities
Bonus if you have experience in data visualizations with D3.js
Bachelors in Computer Science or equivalent technical degree is essential (Masters or PhD is a plus)

Mission:
Democratize machine data analytics through the Sumo Logic platform, bringing real-time data insights securely through the cloud.

Investors include Battery Ventures, Greylock Partners, Sutter Hill Ventures, Accel Partners, Sequoia Capital, Sapphire Ventures and DFJ Growth.

Senior Software Engineer,-1,"At Ezoic, we're building a better internet experience with our all-in-one digital publishing platform. We are looking for motivated, fast-learning developers who are excited to build products that scale to millions of visitors every day.

At its core, our product uses artificial intelligence to learn how users interact with digital content and proactively delivers the optimal front end for every visitor to our customers' sites. We've built tools to automatically generate progressive web apps, in-depth reporting dashboards to give publishers novel insights into their users, data pipelines to process hundreds of millions of events, and tools to vastly increase throughput and effectiveness of our machine learning decisions, just to name a few. We're continuously growing, and we're looking for frontend and backend developers who love building and solving problems across the entire tech stack.

Technologies you'll work with:
Big Data: It's the backbone of everything we do. We use Redshift and MySQL to store just about everything you could imagine about a visitor's interactions with digital content.
Machine Learning: We use tensorflow, scikit-learn, Python, Golang, and state-of-the-art tools we've developed in-house to make data-driven decisions about the kinds of ads, content, and layouts to show each visitor.
Web Development: We build customer-facing dashboards, apps, and internal tools using whatever framework is best for the job, whether it's Vue.js, Angular, JS, Go or PHP. Plus, with a wide variety of digital publishers, you'll get experience working with a diverse set of web development technologies.
Cloud Computing: Our stack is built primarily upon AWS (EC2, Dynamo, RDS, Kinesis, etc.), along with other tools such as Kubernetes, Docker, and Apache Spark.
What you'll need:

5+ years of experience as a software engineer
Strong coding fundamentals: you're an expert in at least one language (e.g. Golang, Python, JavaScript, C++), and you're eager to learn more.
Web development experience (AJAX, HTML, CSS, PHP, React, Angular, etc.)
Experience with databases (PostgreSQL, Redshift, MySQL, or similar)
A drive to solve problems
Life as an Ezoic engineer:

Ezoic is an inaugural member of the Google Certified Publishing Partner Program. This means we work closely with Google to help websites optimize their ad revenue. We actually have won awards directly from Google for the artificial intelligence that we've built. Cool, right?!?

Ezoic is a technology-first company. Our CEO is a developer by trade, and our engineers are given all the tools needed to succeed. We empower our engineers to make a lot of their own decisions about both design and implementation, and encourage them to come up with new ideas to improve the application. We also aim to keep a good work-life balance, based on our philosophy that happy engineers are more productive. We want you to be working on something that you are passionate about and allow engineers to move around to keep things fresh.

While we are all working remotely now because of Covid, we have a brand new office in Carlsbad, CA, where we plan to return next year sometimes when the world goes back to normal. Every engineer works at their own quad-monitor setup on a standing desk. We pride ourselves on getting stuff done, but when you need a break, Ezoic offers great perks, including unlimited vacation time, catered lunches, snacks, flexible hours, ping pong, video games, and pool.

PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES:

•Collaborate with investment staff to create and maintain prototypes of research models and portfolio management applications, facilitating research-driven investment activity and enabling further research. Create working interim solutions, starting with a minimum viable solution and iteratively refining until a satisfactory solution is achieved.

•Develop code libraries and solutions that leverage and appropriately augment existing structures to meet the needs of the research-driven investment and analysis processes (including analyses requested by or directed to clients and prospects), often in the absence of clearly documented specifications.

•Guide analysts and other Multi Asset associates in current technology best practices and advise or teach better programming techniques where needed and appropriate

•Consult with core developers (IT) to identify which interim solutions (e.g., tools, applications, reports, data structures, etc.) have matured sufficiently to transition to a production environment, and produce specifications for such solutions, enabling IT to elevate strategically targeted prototypes to production.

•Maintain knowledge in the field by reading professional journals, talking with other researchers, and attending professional conferences.

REQUIREMENTS:

•Bachelor’s degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., Computer Science, Engineering, Math, Physics); strong academic credentials

•Established track record (5+ years) developing software and applications, including experience in quantitative/modeling environments (e.g. Matlab, Splus, R, Python) and SQL databases

•Practical understanding of Computer Science fundamentals and all layers of modern application design

•Demonstrated ability to learn and work in new computing environments and languages

•Ability to pivot between prototyping, refactoring, and production-ready development styles, ideally demonstrated by prior experience

•Evidence of ability to independently deliver results and self-direction, along with strong initiative

•Strong analytical and problem-solving skills; willingness to learn new approaches to problem-solving

•Familiarity with financial markets across asset classes, supported by coursework and experience

•Demonstrated interest in understanding the broader business context within which a technology solution is needed (focus on the problem, not the code)

•Experience working with large, complex data sets

•Ability to modulate oral and written communications to different levels of technical capability

•Comfort with ambiguity in problem specification and still-emerging objectives; ability and willingness to adjust to mid-stream changes in objectives or process

•High level of pragmatism; able to apply varying levels of rigor appropriately to different projects based on the nature of the project and surrounding circumstances

•Ability to multi-task and to simultaneously push forward several projects

PREFERRED:

•Possession of or commitment to obtaining CFA charter

•Graduate degree in a quantitative discipline (e.g., Computer Science, Engineering, Math, Physics)

•Background in statistics or data science

•Experience designing and working with web service architectures

•Experience designing web frontends and/or modern web frameworks and visualization packages

•Experience leading projects involving teams featuring a heterogenous mix of skill sets

•Experience navigating and bridging gaps in context or understanding that arise between Investment and Technology components of an organization

•Experience leading a small or medium-sized team consisting of other developers or equivalents

Frontend Engineer (ES8/React/Redux/Saga),-1,"Location: Work From Your Home for our All-Remote Company (USA only)

Are you an expert at React, Redux, Webpack, browser APIs, ES8, and the rest of today’s modern frontend stack? Do you want to work on a web application used by hundreds of thousands of users?

If so, we’d like you to learn about Files.com!

At Files.com, we’ve invested heavily in the React/Redux platform and are looking to expand our growing team of frontend developers. As a frontend developer at Files.com, you will work on all of our client-facing web applications that are primarily written in Javascript targeting a web browser.

Additionally, you will get the opportunity to work on mobile apps using React Native as well.

About Files.com


Files.com is a cloud storage and file logistics service with over 1,500 paying business customers, including Target, Canonical, UPS, Leica, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.

Our company consists of USA-based remote employees who work from home.

We’re Bootstrapped, Profitable, and Growing


Our success comes from building a great service that solves problems for
our customers, and our growth comes from expanding and
improving our products as quickly as we can.

We believe that great products can only be built by great people.
So we’re on a quest to find the smartest, most creative, and most
motivated people, and create an environment in which
they thrive.

We Are A Remote Company


You will work from home and have some flexibility to choose your
working hours, allowing you to make time for family, recreation,
vacations, or anything that is important to you.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20
days of PTO for vacations. You’ll have the time to take longer
vacations and have fun.

As our employees’ safety is a top priority, and we want to ensure we do not further spread COVID-19, we have paused all company travel. Once it is safe to resume travelling, you’ll travel to in-person meetings with your team and the entire
company to meet and work together face to face. These meetings are in
cities around the US, including Austin, Orlando, New Orleans, San Diego, Las Vegas, and New York City.

We think that these in-person meetings are vital to the success of a
remote team.

About the Role


Our frontend developers are responsible for all client-side code that runs in browsers and mobile apps here at Files.com. We use state-of-the-art tooling, such as React 16, Redux, Redux-Saga, and React Native on the mobile side.

We obsess about testing, code reviews, and keeping production code size low.

Files.com currently has many features that are available in its API that are not available in its frontend UIs, so a considerable part of this job will be building out new features and releasing them to customers as soon as they’re ready.

Here are some example projects that our Frontend Developers have worked on recently or will work on soon:
Rebuilding our internal CRM dashboard in React.
Building a browser-based file uploader that works in all browsers, supports resume, and is able to automatically detect the closest server for uploading.
Building notification panes that show “push notifications” to our users about updates to their files or workflows.
Enhancing our security by adding several new Two-Factor Authentication methods, such as U2F, SMS, and Yubikey.
Minimum Qualifications:


5+ years of applicable experience.
Experience building and delivering React/Redux applications that have seen actual production usage.
Understanding of the language features of ES6 and ES8.
Understanding of common browser APIs and recent extensions to the HTTP protocol as they relate to frontend development.
Understanding of how to write secure frontend code and an awareness of common web application security vulnerabilities.
Testing and the ability to write unit tests/specs (we use popular JavaScript testing frameworks)
Preferred Qualifications:


Experience with at least one major Redux side effect library such as Redux-Thunk, Redux-Saga, Redux-Loop (We use Redux-Saga).
Contributions to major open source projects.
Our Core Beliefs


Here are just some of our Core Beliefs:

We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide
variety of programming language experience. We don’t hire for specific
programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who are
fluent in several programming languages. We want our staff to be
adaptable and ready to evolve to what’s next.

We believe in using the right tool for the job. Our core applications
are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP. We use Rails, React,
Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL,
Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source
systems. We don’t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a
tool just because “that’s how it’s done around here.”

We believe that open-source only works if companies give back. If you
work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at
Files.com, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull
request back to the upstream project. And if you build something from
scratch while working here that’s generic and not related to our core
products, we want you to release that on GitHub too. We’ll also pay
your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.

We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves. We are
our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their
paces every day.

Salary, Pay, and Benefits


Files.com offers industry-leading salaries based on experience combined with unparalleled flexibility and other benefits to secure top talent.

You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 days of PTO for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.

We will provide you a laptop and a $1,000 signing bonus to purchase a new monitor, desk, or anything else that would help build or refresh your home office.

We’ll update your salary annually based on your performance, as reviewed by your peers.

We fully pay base plan health insurance premiums (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 75% of your spouse or dependents if they wish to join your chosen plan. We want your family to be healthy.

Ready To Apply?

We’d like you to write a cover letter specific to this position at Files.com. Please make sure

In addition to product development, you will also help with:
Designing and implementing our Style Guide of reusable components to make UI development a breeze. Components are APIs, how do you build them with proper abstraction and control principles?

We :heart: TypeScript! As a superset of JavaScript, it has been growing incredibly quickly. What new features should we incorporate into our work?
We’re always looking for ways to improve our testing strategy. What is the ideal combination of unit and functional tests to enable developer productivity while also preventing bugs?
As for the technical rundown, we use React and TypeScript on the frontend, and Scala with Thrift on the server-side. MySQL is our primary datastore, Spark and Kafka power various big data and streaming features, and we run nearly everything on AWS.

AS ShakeAlert Tester,-1,"Astor & Sanders Corporation, an award-winning IT solutions provider located in Rockville, MD, is currently seeking a ShakeAlert Tester/Developer. This position will be remote and based in the United States. A successful candidate must be able to travel to the nearest US Geological Survey (USGS) facility with dedicated IT Support if required.

GENERAL INFORMATION/SCOPE

Southern California is a seismically active region with a large population at risk from damaging earthquakes. USGS, in partnership with universities like Caltech, UC Berkeley, and University of Washington, and other partners, has developed a West Coast earthquake early warning system. Currently, alerts are sent to CA, with the eventual plan to send alerts as needed to anywhere on the West Coast. The intent of this project is to send both accurate and timely alerts to give as many people as possible a warning before heavy shaking is experienced. The system uses seismic data from stations in the field, and may incorporate geodetic from field stations in the future. The waveform information is relayed to data centers for processing, to determine in realtime if an earthquake has occurred. If an earthquake is detected and the magnitude of the event and ground motion of the shaking are above specified thresholds, then alerts are sent through a variety of mechanisms to warn the public and inform technical users.

A key component of the ShakeAlert project is the testing platform that analyzes algorithm performance before it is deployed to the production system.

Because ShakeAlert is a cooperative project between USGS and university partners the contractor will be expected to collaborate with USGS and university scientists and developers.

This work can be accomplished remotely, with an expectation of attending ShakeAlert tele-meetings, engaging in frequent communication with the Pasadena office, and visiting occasionally.

"Senior Software Engineer (Frontend), Along, Education",-1,"Founded by Dr. Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg in 2015, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) is a new kind of philanthropy that's leveraging technology to help solve some of the world's toughest challenges – from eradicating disease, to improving education, to reforming the criminal justice system. Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.

Our Values


We believe we can help build a future for everyone.
We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.
Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

The Opportunity

Our work in education is aimed at ensuring that every student — not just a lucky few — can get an education that's tailored to their individual needs and supports every aspect of their development. We're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy, and advocacy work to help every young person enter adulthood with the skills and abilities they need to reach their full potential — and equip every teacher with the tools and research they need to help students get there.

We know that when students feel supported, cared for, and understood, they thrive. Now more than ever, teachers and students need efficient and supportive tools to ensure education is anchored in relationships and well-being. Along is a new tool designed to achieve exactly that – a free, interactive video journal designed to foster meaningful connections between teachers and students.

Along provides a meaningful space where teachers and students can share one-on-one reflections via recorded video or text conversations and dive into important topics — such as managing stress, staying motivated, and navigating the new challenges these times present. The Along team is looking for a Senior Software Engineer to build scalable and engaging experiences.

Technical Lead Manager - Frontend (React),-1,"At Sisu, we're building a software platform that empowers people to make better decisions using data. Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.

Sisu is a fundamental rearchitecture of how users interact with data. Instead of relying on users to tell us what they want to see, as in traditional dashboarding systems, Sisu predicts users’ intent based on their metrics of interest, past behaviors, and other organizations like them. We take this kind of predictive analysis for granted in consumer applications (e.g., Netflix, Google, Facebook), but the hardest interface design and ranking problems lie in making private data found in everyday organizations actionable. The key problem we’re solving as a first step in this direction is to help identify what’s driving change in key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn among the enormous set of factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels. To do so, we combine statistical analysis and machine learning at scale to provide users personalized, real-time diagnoses of changes in their metrics via an explainable, interpretable user interface.

As a Technical Lead Manager at Sisu, you’ll be instrumental in shaping the future of Sisu’s product interface - a web application that our customers will rely on to “get the facts” to make data driven decisions, as well as the team and company culture behind that. You’ll have the opportunity to work on technical challenges including developing our information architecture and solving unique problems, including how to represent statistical data in a digestible way to end users of various knowledge levels.
What you'll accomplish

Full Stack Developer,-1,"We are seeking a motivated Full Stack Developer to join one of our small scrum teams and continue kicking-ass, delivering the sexiest most efficient software known to the government. That’s right, this isn’t your father’s development project, we are building mission critical applications that will shape the future; a future where you have direct impact!

We are truly building the best in breed software, so naturally we are an interesting animal. Our frontend is largely Angular8 and deployed to the web, desktop (via Electron), and mobile (via Cordova). The frontend communicates with backend services though lightweight RESTful API calls to the serviceMesh gateway (Envoy, FreeIPA, NiFi, & HaProxy) which themselves broker requests to an event store (Kafka). Once in Kafka, individual services perform their respective actions in accordance with a pure pub/sub model. Our backend is largely comprised of ’serverless’ microservices, with most being ran on firecracker (AWS Lambda’s engine) and those too large (like Kafka, Elastic Search, etc.) are ran in containers on Kubernetes. Of course, we’ve got some secret sauce here and there, but we are using open standards wherever possible.

The ideal candidate will:
Be eager to learn new technologies and expand their roles and responsibilities.
Excel at translating functional requirements into quality code.
Have a knack for efficiency.
Be familiar with industry best practices and open-source enablers (libraries, tools, tech).
Possess a demonstrable acumen for detail, but not quite debilitating perfectionism.
Be comfortable thinking outside the box and proposing better methods to code/structure the app.
Be comfortable with agile software development (don’t worry, we aren’t a sweat-shop).
Have solid technical understanding and experience with Angular (6+ years).
Be familiar with event-streaming architectures (using Kafka & serviceMeshes).
Be familiar with modularity and microservice architectures.
Have experience creating NodeJS microservices
Each scrum member is both a leader and a follower. As a Senior developer, you will be expected to help mentor more junior developers, but do expect to learn a thing or two yourself.

Some travel may be required on an as needed basis. Eventually, this position may require a government security clearance.

Office hours are flexible with most work performed remotely (as we are a geographically dispersed team) but some actions may require travel and regular team interaction. Most of our team works out of on-trend, workshare office spaces around the nation.

We offer competitive benefits (fully-vested up to 10% 401k matching, 100% company-paid comprehensive healthcare, all 10 federal holidays & 15 days leave, flexible schedules, educational reimbursements, and much more).

Skyward Federal is a small (but growing) startup bringing the best of breed to the most exciting & unique missions possible. We work hard but play harder. There is constant room for growth and cross-training depending on what your life goals are. Apply now & start your journey today!

Remote Ruby on Rails Engineer,-1,"Aha! engineering is a mid-sized, fully remote team. We are centered around North American time zones so we can collaborate during the workday.
Our core values
The Responsive Method: These 8 principles drive how we operate Aha! and serve customers and employees.
Moving quickly: We ship code multiple times a day. We believe in getting new features in front of customers and iteratively improving as we learn what works and what does not.
Product over process: We want our engineers to have the time and focus to solve complex challenges. We aim to minimize the overhead introduced by heavyweight processes and excessive meetings.
Collaboration: We each bring unique experiences and skills to the table. Working together to share that knowledge benefits the entire team and helps us produce the best results for our customers.
Who we're looking for
We believe that being a kind person who elevates the rest of the team is just as valuable as writing great code. We look for strong problem-solving skills and experience working on important functionality for a cloud-based product. We need people who are humble, eager to learn, and always willing to help others learn as well. We want to work with people who enjoy picking up a problem and solving it, regardless of the technologies and techniques involved.
Most of our features involve writing significant Ruby on Rails code, so we need meaningful past experience working in a Rails codebase. We also write a lot of React, but we are happy to help you learn that part on the job.
Our technology
Our sole product is the Aha! web application. It is a single-instance, multi-tenant Ruby on Rails monolith supported by Postgres (database), Redis (background jobs), and memcached (Rails caching). We also run a Node.js webserver to support collaborative editing and real-time updates. Our application is hosted on Amazon Web Services and architected with ECS for reproducibility and scalability.
We utilize a growing amount of React on the frontend to build rich client-side experiences, including our fully collaborative text editor and our slide presentation editor. We balance the strengths of both technologies — Rails for its conventions and simplicity and React for more powerful interactive functionality.
We embrace new technologies that help us deliver a lovable product, but we also remain cognizant of the maintenance overhead that a new library or platform brings. We solve the problems in front of us rather than prematurely optimizing to address issues that may never materialize.
We do most of our collaboration and planning in Aha! itself, which we find especially rewarding. We also utilize GitHub, Slack, and GoToMeeting for video calls.
What you’ll be doing
We work on a broad range of features across the full stack. Your work will include:
Implementing new features for our users, touching each layer of the MVC as needed
Building deeply interactive reporting interfaces using React
Working proactively with product and UX to refine and iterate on specifications as the feature takes shape
Investigating slow performance and optimizing queries to ensure Aha! is snappy and satisfying to use
Interfacing directly with users to quickly squash bugs as part of our regular customer support rotation
Documenting components in our style guide to help drive consistency
If this sounds appealing, we would love to hear from you. A real human reviews every application, so please use the form to help us learn more about you.",4.7,"Aha!

Senior Software Engineer - Frontend/Full-stack,-1,"At Sisu, we're building a software platform that empowers people to make better decisions using data. Based on years of cutting-edge research at Stanford, Sisu enables users to quickly and comprehensively understand what’s driving their key metrics, so they never miss a window of opportunity to act.

Sisu is a fundamental rearchitecture of how users interact with data. Instead of relying on users to tell us what they want to see, as in traditional dashboarding systems, Sisu predicts users’ intent based on their metrics of interest, past behaviors, and other organizations like them. We take this kind of predictive analysis for granted in consumer applications (e.g., Netflix, Google, Facebook), but the hardest interface design and ranking problems lie in making private data found in everyday organizations actionable. The key problem we’re solving as a first step in this direction is to help identify what’s driving change in key metrics like revenue, retention, and churn among the enormous set of factors like user demographics, campaigns, and acquisition channels. To do so, we combine statistical analysis and machine learning at scale to provide users personalized, real-time diagnoses of changes in their metrics via an explainable, interpretable user interface.

As a Sr. Frontend/Full-stack Engineer, you’ll be a subject matter expert shaping the future of Sisu’s product interface - a web application that our customers will rely on to “get the facts” to make data driven decisions. You’ll have the opportunity to work on technical challenges including developing our information architecture and solving unique problems, including how to represent statistical data in a digestible way to end users of various knowledge levels.
What you'll do:
Scale our Typescript / React / Redux front-end
Provide technical leadership to drive consensus based on empirical evidence
Navigate ambiguity with an open and curious cross-functional team
Understand our end user (data analyst) to eventually build a general use product
Craft a unique user experience that brings value to global brands. See Samsung and Upwork.
Actively partner with product and design to architect user empowering interfaces with performance and scalability in mind
Cultivate your design skills and transform Figma mocks into working prototypes
Shape the engineering culture through mentorship as our small, dynamic team grows
Actively participate in customer POCs to optimize customer experience and adoption.
About you

Expertise with React and Redux
Expertise with Javascript or Typescript
Fluency in HTML, CSS, and ES6

So if you’re ready to work on unrivaled technology where your desire to be part of a collaborative team is met with a laser-focused mission to stop breaches and protect people globally, let’s talk.

About the Role

We’re building a welcoming & flexible team that prizes collaboration over competition, one which provides opportunities to learn new skills, mentor junior developers and contribute to the direction of both the team & the products we’re responsible for. This is a high trust environment where we allow team members to manage their own time, take holidays as they need it and reward them with competitive salaries and equity.

Our stack is Ember, but if you've used frameworks like React or Angular you're the kind of person we're looking for and we'll help get you up to speed. As we support only evergreen browsers we can push the boundaries of what’s possible on the web as a platform, on top of a system that strips any hyperbole from the term “big data”.

CSPM is a new and complementary product area for CrowdStrike. We’re extending CrowdStrike’s mission of “stopping breaches” into the public cloud control plane and native cloud resources. CrowdStrike’s CSPM offering will give customers visibility into both the (mis)configuration and compliance of native cloud resources, and potential adversary activity involving those resources. When coupled with Falcon, CrowdStrike’s endpoint security offering, our CSPM offering will provide a more comprehensive perspective on how the adversary is targeting key customer infrastructure.

Our goal is to learn what it would be like to work with you, and since we collaborate as a team at work, that's what we'll be doing in the interview.

The Dwelo R&D Team

We are a remote-enabled team. While our headquarters is in Draper, Utah, our engineers live all over the United States. The way we build our product and make decisions takes geographically distributed collaboration into account.

Dwelo is designed to serve all people, everywhere. Our success is dependent on taking many, varied perspectives into consideration. Seeking out, hiring, and enabling people from all backgrounds to implement their ideas is critical to success of Dwelo as a healthy company and as a product.

For logistical reasons, we can only consider applicants that are eligible to work in the United States.

Dwelo R&D Missions

As internet connected devices become ubiquitous and interwoven into our world, and our product focus has expanded to building a platform other device services can be built upon, Dwelo Research & Development's responsibility and mission has necessarily also expanded. Our mission is designed to empower every engineer to make decisions when building Dwelo. And we fundamentally believe that it is necessary to have a shared understanding of what is important as a team. The people we serve are always at the center of our missions.

We believe that we must take a strong stand on personal privacy. IoT has the awesome and terrible potential to benefit humans while encroaching on our most sacred rights: privacy. Dwelo will never share personal information with a third party, and especially never to an advertiser. We remain committed to making an ongoing statement on the importance of privacy in a connected age, in the design of our products, how we integrate with third parties, and our statements as a corporation.

The hardware and software we build must enable all people to live more full lives. It must benefit individual humans, either by making their jobs less laborious and more efficient, or making the way they live more convenient and pleasant. All kinds of people, from all origins live in Dwelo apartments, or interact with Dwelo-connected devices, and many of them have disabilities. Dwelo's human focus nature puts accessibility in the forefront of our design and development.

We believe that personal security is a critical aspect of enabling people to live more full lives. This is important enough to elevate to a central imperative for Dwelo R&D. In this mission, we consider the security of individual's digital identity and data alongside their physical security. Our product roadmap must always include steps to enhance both, and neither can ever be sacrificed for any reason.",4.7,"Dwelo Inc

About Quora:


The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it.

All new and existing Atlassians will continue to work from home until it’s safe to return to our offices. When our offices re-open, every Atlassian will have the choice to work from an office or from home.

Here at Trello, we celebrate the many ways we work. With a team of over one hundred, we connect from Atlanta coworking spaces, Minnesota forests, Hawaii beaches and our beautiful headquarters in Manhattan, where this position will be based. We expect our developers to contribute more than just code. You’ll be involved in defining how things work, what they do, and why we do that instead of something else. We also expect you to share your knowledge and expertise with everyone else. In other words, we’re all whole humans and expect the same from you. If that interests you, read on to learn more about the role.
Key Responsibilities:
Work directly with product managers, designers and developers on features for the Trello web application.
Proactively optimize client code to ensure stability and high performance.
Iterate quickly based on user feedback.
More About You
You could be working at any level of the stack, but you’re passionate about front-end development.
You have in-depth experience with a framework like AngularJS, Backbone.js (our current framework) or React (what we’re moving to).
You have enough back-end experience to jump over to the server to unblock yourself (we use node.js).
You’re passionate about understanding user problems and working with a team to ship and iterate on great solutions.
You strive to write code that lasts for years, not months.
You have a diverse technical background. You’re a developer, not just a front-end developer.
You know the difference between ECMAScript and JavaScript, and are proud (or slightly ashamed) of it.
You can tweak CSS, but you prefer profiling, analyzing heap snapshots, and refactoring code into modular chunks.
You have an excellent command of written and spoken English.
U.S. Bachelor or higher degree, or its equivalent, in Computer Science, Information Technology, Information Systems Management or a closely related field of study.

Product is a highly collaborative initiative across multiple teams. Engineers are expected to understand and have product input, designing systems towards our long-term product vision.

Principal Software Engineer,-1,"Who we are:


Grabango is the leading provider of checkout-free shopper technology for existing stores. Founded by Will Glaser (co-founder/former CTO of Pandora Media), the Grabango team has developed the only enterprise class solution for large store chains in the market today. Grabango's system accommodates thousands of store locations, hundreds of thousands of SKUs and millions of square feet across a given retail enterprise.

We're a growing group of kind, curious, self-directed people working towards a common goal. We delight in taking risks and testing hypotheses in a collaborative and supportive environment. Our ability to celebrate both our successes and failures as milestones of growth opens the door to tremendous breakthroughs.

Computer vision and machine learning are at the core of our patent pending technology. Our accomplished team is a potent combination of technology and commerce professionals that are looking to ""Eliminate lines and save people time!""

Role Overview:

Grabango seeks an experienced backend software engineer to help design and build its distributed systems, ML/CV, and data pipelining infrastructures. In order to generate a receipt based on computer vision only, we need to have tools to process massive amounts of video and other downstream data, making decisions about real-world events at every layer of our infrastructure simultaneously. Additionally, the system doing this work needs to be able to scale horizontally, and be fault tolerant at every layer.

We are looking for a flexible, curious engineer with deep experience of high-throughput distributed systems using modern tooling and languages. Though we use many tools, depth of experience with Python and its use with distributed and real-time systems (Celery + Redis / RabbitMQ, Kafka + Faust, etc) will be central to this role. Deep working experience with the placement of different kinds of data in microservice architectures will be a critical element of this role as we work towards the infinitely scalable future. Shared tools such as Kubernetes, Docker and Git should be second-nature.

As a deeply technical lead, the ideal candidate will prefer spending about 50% of their time actually writing code, splitting the rest between planning and mentorship and code review. We are looking for an engineer who has already seen success in growing their team around them, as well as engineering highly available high-throughput distributed systems.

This full-time role reports directly to the Sr. Engineering Manager (Scale Team) and is based in Berkeley.

What you'll be doing:


Within the first 3 months
Getting up to speed on our various systems
Expanding our data pipeline across multiple networks
Instrumenting code to help us find areas to improve our designs
Working with other developers to identify and resolve bugs
Reducing latency and improving reliability of our internal APIs
Collaborating on system design to optimize petabyte-scale data set management
Supporting frontend developers in expanding our labeling and management system
Within the first 6 months
Designing distributed computing infrastructure for real time data processing
Scaling computer vision algorithms to run massively parallel in production
Determining technical roadmap based on current tech maturity and business objectives

What you should have:


8+ years Python and/or C++ experience with mastery of modern language features and libraries
Depth of experience with distributed and real-time systems, infrastructure, frameworks, and datastores
Second-nature familiarity with shared tools: Kubernetes, Docker, Git
You recognize the need to balance pragmatism and creativity
You have made mistakes, learned from them and avoided making them again.
You are able to use your knowledge and experience to help solve problems that may not be in your field of expertise
You work well with a diverse team of high-quality people focused on customer delight.
You can rapidly become familiar with and apply new tools and technologies

Educations & Certifications:


BS or equivalent experience in Computer Science or Computer Engineering

Grabango Values:
Integrity: Do the right thing, particularly when you don't have to.

Bold Innovation: Think recklessly, but temper your actions with pragmatism.

People Matter: Hire the best, and treasure them.

Don't Live with Broken: Have the courage to admit mistakes, and the urgency to correct them.

Customer Focus: Deliver beyond expectations, both internally and externally.

Inclusion: Foster an environment that welcomes all.

Simplify: Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.

More than a job


Where you work isn't just a career decision -- it's a life decision. We get it. That's why we want all of our Gurus to feel a sense of belonging that comes from feeling supported in all areas of their lives. Everyone has family, friends and interests outside of their careers, so we offer perks and benefits to make work, work better for you.
4 weeks PTO, plus 10 sick days, and holidays. Whether it's hiking to a waterfall in Costa Rica or bonding with your couch, we all need downtime. All Gurus get four weeks paid time off, 10 sick days, and enough holiday to make a banker blush.
Let's get lunch. Lunches are catered three times per week, and our kitchen stays stocked with a smorgasbord of the team's most requested snacks and drinks.
Parking is on us. We have your Downtown parking covered. We offer paid garage parking nearby the office. We also have perks for going green by walking and taking public transit.
We've got you covered. We offer insurance plans that pay for 100% of your medical, dental, and vision, and 80% for your family/dependents.
Gender-neutral paid parental leave. Expanding your family? We offer 12 weeks of gender-neutral paid parental leave, and reimburse up to $10,000 for eligible adoption expenses.
$1,000 continuing education budget. All Gurus get $250 a quarter to spend on personal development, and 2 hours each week reserved for learning something new.
Remote where?


The A Cloud Guru team has grown a lot since it was just two brothers with a dream of teaching the world to cloud! We now employ gurus in 30 states of the USA as well as in Australia and the UK. For the time being that's as far as we can go. We won't bore you with the details, but setting up the extra operations we would need to employ people in new states or countries is a little bit more expensive than replicating your database in another AZ, if you know what we mean. So as much as we would love to have staff in as many countries as we have students, we are only opening this role to applicants in areas we currently have operations.

If you're not sure if your US state is included, please still apply! We will let you know if you are in a state that we currently don't have operations. If anything changes we will reach back out.

What's the interview process like at ACG?


Applying for a job can feel intimidating and like a full-time job of its own. You shouldn't have to burn through a week of sick time or all your best out-of-office excuses just to put feelers out for a new career opportunity. We want to be as transparent about the process as possible to help ease your mind. It's our goal to provide you a fair, efficient interviewing experience that respects you and your time and to do it all with a sidecar of delight.

Once you submit an application, we'll review it. If you're a good fit, you'll have an initial chat with a recruiter over the phone. A phone interview with a manager typically follows. Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). Then we'll schedule a Zoom call to meet other members of the team, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it's really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.

FAST, which has a U.S. office in Iselin, New Jersey and an international office in Hyderabad, India, was founded in 2010 to provide an alternative to the overly burdensome solutions available in the market.

At FAST, we recognize that each insurance company faces a unique set of issues and challenges, and that a tremendous amount of creativity and capability is required to craft and implement the best solution. That’s why FAST was built on an agile mindset. FAST, in concert with Verisk, is focused on providing innovative technology and analytics solutions for the life insurance industry. We’re continuously learning and improving, constantly challenging the status quo, and always seeking a “win/win” for our customers, partners, and employees.

Our global team uses AI, machine learning, automation, and other emerging technologies to collect and analyze billions of records. We provide advanced decision-support to prevent credit, lending, and cyber risks. In addition, we monitor and advise companies on complex global matters such as climate change, catastrophes, and geopolitical issues.

But why we do our work is what sets us apart. It stems from a commitment to making the world better, safer and stronger.

It’s the reason Verisk is part of the UN Global Compact sustainability initiative. It’s why we made a commitment to balancing 100 percent of our carbon emissions. It’s the aim of our “returnship” program for experienced professionals rejoining the workforce after time away. And, it’s what drives our annual Innovation Day, where we identify our next first-to-market innovations to solve our customers’ problems.

At its core, Verisk uses data to minimize risk and maximize value. But far bigger, is why we do what we do.

About Scratch
Scratch's mission is to build a repayment platform to change the way consumers experience debt. Most of us take on debt to help us get ahead, or in many cases, to not fall behind. But for most of us—despite its necessity—once we have debt, it doesn't play a healthy role in our lives. It can be hard to understand, difficult to manage, and unaccommodating to changes in our lives.

This is why we started Scratch. We wanted to reinvent the loan servicing industry, well—from scratch. We wanted to create a world where debt plays a healthier and less taxing role in more people's lives. By bringing world-class product and technical thinking to a multi-trillion industry that hasn't seen innovation in well over two decades, Scratch's platform empowers borrowers to have greater control, visibility and flexibility over their financial health, removing the traditional loan servicer from the equation altogether and bringing borrowers closer to their lenders.

Our team is rapidly growing and comes from diverse backgrounds including Google, Dropbox, Amazon, Pinterest, Facebook and Affirm. Our office is based in San Francisco.

With a growing community of lenders and borrowers, we think it's time the world knows there's a better way to pay back their loans. We'd love for you to join in our mission and help play a role in changing the way we experience debt for the better!",4.5,"Scratch

About Quora:


The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission.

Every day, millions of people seek answers and share their knowledge through Quora. To foster this marketplace of knowledge, we need to build systems that make sharing knowledge rewarding and discovering it easy; that show you answers to questions you didn't know you had, on topics you didn't know you liked, and that scale to support the participation of the entire planet.

The Product Engineering teams focus on growth, engagement, and activation. This work includes how we distribute content to the right people, how we curate content on Quora, and how we engage new users, content contributors, and readers.

Here at Trello, we celebrate the many ways we work. With a team of over one hundred, we connect from Atlanta coworking spaces, Minnesota forests, Hawaii beaches and our beautiful headquarters in Manhattan, where this position will be based. We expect our developers to contribute more than just code. You’ll be involved in defining how things work, what they do, and why we do that instead of something else. We also expect you to share your knowledge and expertise with everyone else. In other words, we’re all whole humans and expect the same from you. If that interests you, read on to learn more about the role.
Key Responsibilities:
Work directly with product managers, designers and developers on features for the Trello web application.

You have enough back-end experience to jump over to the server to unblock yourself (we use node.js).
You’re passionate about understanding user problems and working with a team to ship and iterate on great solutions.
You strive to write code that lasts for years, not months.
You have a diverse technical background. You’re a developer, not just a front-end developer.

You can tweak CSS, but you prefer profiling, analyzing heap snapshots, and refactoring code into modular chunks.
You have an excellent command of written and spoken English.
U.S. Bachelor or higher degree, or its equivalent, in Computer Science, Information Technology, Information Systems Management or a closely related field of study.

Digital Diagnostics is looking for a Principal Frontend Software Engineer to help build our flexible, configurable, and beautiful frontend software.

Our flagship product is the artificial intelligence algorithm where it is the computer, not the physician, diagnosing patients. Built on a series of patented machine learning algorithms, our FDA cleared software platform detects early signs of diabetic retinopathy, a debilitating eye disease that impacts the 30+ million people with diabetes in the US. We are using everything we’ve learned from IDx-DR to expand our artificial intelligence platform to help patients by detecting diseases like skin cancer. This expansion is critically enabled by our efforts in the healthcare IT space, through EHR integrations, platform connections, and analytics. Now we need to expand our team of highly skilled and motivated team members to help us change healthcare for the better.

Working for Digital Diagnostics offers you the opportunity to:
Work with world-renowned computer scientists and clinicians who are pushing the limits of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning in medicine.
Tackle complex challenges and projects with the highest levels of quality and execution for audiences that include top technologists, the FDA, and world-leading healthcare providers.
Push the accessibility and quality of healthcare to new heights to improve the lives of millions of people.
Work at the forefront of programmatic UI design to allow for flexible, configurable, and beautiful UIs
Are you someone who:
Has your team’s back and is willing to jump into any problem
Enjoys delighting the customer
Goes all in, learns from their mistakes, and has fun doing it
8+ years of software development experience
Then apply to be our next Principal Frontend Software Engineer!

Qualifications (aka this is what we will ask about in your interview):
Very strong technical communication skills: you should be comfortable interacting with and explaining designs to everyone from customers, to the CEO, to the developers working with you
Expertise in taking lead on designing and building complex software solutions, from conception to deployment
Best practices should be second nature to you, as you will need to implement, design to and teach them
Extensive expertise with both the theory and practice of testing: unit, integration and otherwise
Mastery of HTML/CSS/React and doing just about anything that can be done with them. The DOM should be your playground. The nuances between JavaScript engines should be second nature to you.
Extensive experience designing and implementing ideal user experiences across languages and accessibility levels
Extensive experience with implementing robust Single Page Applications
Interest in SaMD (software as a medical device – if you know, you know) and working in regulated software environments such as ISO or FDA (don’t let this scare you – we have a lot of automation).
This is a permanently remote position. We have engineers across the United States in many different time zones. We are committed to hiring the best engineers no matter where they reside, so location is not factored into compensation. But if you ever long for the comradery of a shared workspace, we have offices in Chicago, Boston and Iowa and would be happy to have you there!

At SimpleCitizen, we make immigration work better for people and companies by transforming manual and inefficient processes into modern, automated workflows. We differentiate from the competition through relentless focus on our customers: the immigration applicant and the people who work at our client companies managing global immigration and mobility programs. For too long, technology in this space has been overly focused on the law firm employees at the expense of delightful user experiences, efficient processes and easy access to data and information when it is needed.

Since our founding in 2014, we've built a reputation of doing whatever it takes to help legal immigrants to the United States obtain permanent residence and citizenship at a fraction of the cost and time of the alternatives, while achieving an industry leading success rate & superb customer reviews and NPS ratings.

We will win because of our uncompromising customer focus, our innovative approach to technology and our recent union with the preeminent legal service provider in the industry.

To achieve this bold mission, we'll need the help of the best people in product, design, and engineering.

Frontend Engineer (Remote),-1,"Hello!

Thanks for checking out our job description for a remote Frontend Engineer at Impala. We felt a little bit impersonal just just diving straight in with words like ""revolutionising"" and ""disrupting"".

As such, we apologise in advance for any clichés, tropes or sudden-insecurity-driven-panic-attacks that you might find in the description below.

What is Impala?

Impala is making the process of booking hotel rooms ridiculously easy. We're providing hotels with a powerful data distribution infrastructure that transforms the way hotel guests across the world browse, book, stay and pay. Think Twilio for Travel.

We launched our original API product in January 2019 and since then have grown at - quite frankly - a ridiculous old clip. Our technology is already installed in hundreds of hotels worldwide, on six continents and categorises more than 1 billion data points. This has allowed us to bring forward our ambition to revolutionise the hotel distribution market and help empower millions of people across the globe.

We are a growing remote-first team of exceptional people split across engineering, product and commercial who make up a thriving, active, supportive community.

Where is Impala going?

We're supported by some of the most respected investors in the business, the early-stage backers behind Deliveroo, PillPack, SecretEscapes, Zoopla, Trivago, Monzo, Travelperk, Transferwise, Airbnb, GetYourGuide, Omio, Spotify and more!

They're on board because of the shared opportunity we have before us - revolutionising a 1.6 trillion dollar market that's been out-of-date for 20 years.

They also share our vision of a future in which travel is seamlessly connected and relentlessly inventive.

Our vision is that within the next two years 10% of hotel bookings worldwide will flow through Impala technology, and the product that we're building will support the entire ecosystem of travel technology (we already have over a thousand companies signed up).

Anyone travelling anywhere will interact with products powered by Impala and to achieve this we're growing the team extensively within the next year. Now is the most exciting time to be joining Impala as we go through a large push to grow and scale, both as a service and a community!

A brief overview of what you will be doing here:

You will be a key contributor to new frontend services, ensuring a high level of quality for both our code and our user experience. Your role will involve analysing and optimising the product and technical performance of features to continually improve customer experience. You will work closely with the Impala design team to create an enjoyable user experience.

You should join us if:
You have strong experience and expertise with ReactJS and good knowledge of JS fundamentals.
You are comfortable working closely with product owners, designers, UX experts and the ability to translate their designs/requirements into maintainable, componentised UIs.
You have experience with the design and consumption of REST APIs.
You have knowledge and ability across the stack, and are able to contribute to and build out backend services where necessary.
Where will you work?

This is a remote position. This means you can work from anywhere +/- 2 Hours of London timezone (and less than a 3 hour flight).

We are a remote-first company! This was a very deliberate, natural choice, as we prioritise preserving work-life balance and accommodating the best people in Europe, while also fostering diversity.

We have loads of remote initiatives to ensure every new member of the team is fully set up!
We provide an additional generous Personalised Workspace Budget for things like monitors, keyboards, desk chairs and headphones.
We offer an office stipend - you can furnish their home office with a generous £150 monthly stipend (coffee, snacks, wifi bills, cleaning, desk equipment, plus anything in between) or we will pay for a co-working membership near where you live.
The full engineering team travels once a quarter to meet and socialise with the rest of the engineering team somewhere in Europe.
We offer a generous Social Budget for you to travel to London-based social events.
We have a dedicated Remote Experience Manager in the team, whose role is, among other things, to ensure everyone in the team's happiness, and help them feel integrated and empowered while working remotely.
We give each new team member a brand new high-spec laptop when they start, with a choice between a Thinkpad or Mac.
Please note, we only accept candidates in Western Europe because of timezone and travel time differences. We make no exceptions (we don't have time to, unfortunately!).

What you will get in return?
We reward Impalans with the most competitive salaries and regular reviews. Whether you're an individual contributor or you want to manage people, there are plenty of opportunities to develop your skills and boost your earning potential. We offer 3.5x the average annual UK raise, even if you remain within the same role.
We're in the top 14% of companies in the UK for the amount of holiday that we offer, at 36 days.
One Unsick day off per year, to keep up with proactive health admin - so you can finally sort that trip to the dentist and get those health screens that you never have time to do.
Flexible working hours with Core Hours from 10-3, meaning you can plan your 9 hour work day around your own schedule.
We invest in your development with a generous £1,000 Professional Development budget per year, and we will support you to realise your potential.
Fun and inclusive monthly social events, from go-karting to mini golf to karaoke to virtual pub quiz.
Access to Perkbox.
Access to Bippit, a financial wellbeing app.
A super strong and proactive focus on mental and physical wellbeing. From Vitality health insurance, to Sanctus, to a monthly gym membership reimbursement, plus heaps more.
A generous Loved Ones Budget - £750 annually to get your friends & family over to visit you once a year, no matter how near or far from home you are based.
Weekly 10% Time.

"Software Engineer, Frontend - Borrower Core",-1,"Blend helps lenders maximize their digital agility. Our digital lending platform is used by Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, and other leading financial institutions to increase customer acquisition, improve productivity, and accelerate the delivery of any banking product across every channel. We process more than $3 billion in mortgages and consumer loans daily, helping millions of consumers get into homes and gain access to the capital they need to lead better lives.

The Borrower Core team builds the experience that all borrowers using the Blend platform go through. We are looking for an engineer to help make sure that users have a seamless, trust-inducing experience regardless of their accessibility needs, demographic, or device (the application is fully responsive, and we see around 35% mobile usage). You’ll own the borrower-facing experience top-to-bottom, and while the work is weighted toward the frontend, many features include backend components as well.

We write frontend features with React in ES6/Typescript. We find that type checking helps us catch errors earlier, test better, and ultimately ship quicker and with higher quality. Because our app is white-labeled (think dynamic styling), we use Aphrodite (CSS-in-JS) for all of our styling. Our team also builds and owns its own deployment infrastructure and application serving pipeline. That way we can ship whenever we need to and have full control over making the delivery pipeline as quick and seamless as possible.

On the backend, we write Node.js/Express in ES6/Typescript, and sometimes Go.
Who you are:
You have 4+ years of experience building high-quality production software
You have deep experience with one or more modern JavaScript frameworks, such as React, Angular, or Vue.js. We use React, but we know you’ll pick it up quickly if you haven’t used it in the past.
You understand accessibility (a11y) best practices.
You’ve worked in a modern product development organization and can effectively collaborate with product and design to guide complex projects to successful outcomes.

How you’ll contribute:

You’ll help to lead architectural decisions to support immediate and future product and platform needs.
You’ll mentor and grow other team members through regular 1:1s, code reviews, and design reviews.
You’ll collaborate with product managers, designers, and other engineers to build new features or revamp existing features.
You’ll bring your experience to bear to help to improve the processes and patterns of the team.
Bonus Points!
Experience with TypeScript.
Experience building enterprise software.
Experience building a UI platform.

"Frontend Engineer (Remote, US)",-1,"It’s an exciting time at Crossbeam. Less than two years post-launch, we have over one thousand companies using our platform, raised more than $40M of venture capital from leading VC firms, and are working with awesome strategic investors like Salesforce, Hubspot, Okta, and Slack. Best of all, we’re just getting started. In a market full of uncertainty, we are fortunate to have an unwavering long-term vision and the funding to see it through at full speed.

Crossbeam helps companies partner with each other in a more data-driven way by acting as an escrow service for data. Our platform allows companies to find overlapping customers and prospects with their partners while keeping the rest of their data private and secure.

With this big idea comes some fun and unique technical challenges: We’re like a social network for data warehouses, so the data gets big and our results need to show up fast; we need to reliably find “matches” between data sets originating from different systems; we need our users to love the experience and capture real value every step of the way; security and trust are paramount. And there’s more where that came from.

You’ll join a small-but-mighty team of experienced engineers to take our software from early success to enterprise scale. This is an opportunity to truly influence and contribute meaningfully to our product and engineering practices and help create a beautiful and functional product.

Responsibilities include
User Interface Development: Work on building new UI features and improvements to Crossbeam’s products in a secure, well-tested, and performant way.
Team Collaboration: Be a partner to our Product Designer, turning design into pixel perfect UIs. Collaborate & learn with various other parts of the team like Product Management, Engineering, and Customer Success teams to iterate on features and enhancements.
Develop & Deploy: Consistently be shipping features and enhancements with guidance from other team members. Work in tandem with other team members to create, test, and deploy code.
Learning & Growth: Get involved with learning, collaborating with your team members. Help cultivate an environment where you can ask and be asked questions that will better the team as a whole.
These are some of your traits
You have at least 3 years professional experience on an engineering team.
You have deep knowledge of modern frontend frameworks, such as Vue or React, and of REST APIs.
You have strong testing practices with tools like Jest, Mocha, or Chai
You have an understanding of interacting with databases, preferably relational (ideally Postgres or MySQL, but Mongo and other NoSQL databases work too).
You can easily work with design tools (Figma, Storybook, Invision, etc)
You follow best practices for documentation & style guides.
You enjoy collaborating with product and design teams to create the best possible UI.
You believe in creating space for people with different backgrounds and viewpoints to share their opinions in a respectful environment.
You embrace complex technical challenges and thrive on discovering simple solutions.
You’re not afraid to speak up when you have a point of view, but can “disagree and commit” once a final decision is reached.
You have an unrivaled work ethic, and are excited to learn from the team around you.
You have experience working remotely as part of a larger team.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

We combine leading experts & operators across the consumer goods & technology industries into a fast-response product development & delivery operation dedicated to the well-being of both the civilian and military communities. This isn't a spin on e-commerce, it's changing the way physical products are made through data.

• Favor shipping over bike-shedding: You love shipping and iterating product. You have a good balance of discussion and collaboration before getting down to business.

What you will be doing
As one of the founding engineers, you will have an immediate impact on the architecture and interfaces for the system we are developing to drive physical product creation and iteration for optimizing human performance. You will focus on the inclusion of data collected from our tester community, deriving insights from data, and surfacing them to the relevant user groups. You will participate in human-centered design activities to ensure you have a firm grasp of the user groups and workflows we will address. You will also be responsible for creating clean, intuitive and insightful interfaces across multi-platforms to address the needs of multiple stakeholders. Talk to us to learn more.

What we're looking for
• You develop clean and crisp user interfaces with modern front-end development frameworks for mobile and web (React, React Native, or Angular).
• You create backend services that scale and are lightning fast with modern services development languages (gRPC, go, or Java).

Grabango is the leading provider of checkout-free shopper technology for existing stores. Founded by Will Glaser (co-founder/former CTO of Pandora Media), the Grabango team has developed the only enterprise class solution for large store chains in the market today. Grabango's system accommodates thousands of store locations, hundreds of thousands of SKUs and millions of square feet across a given retail enterprise.

We're a growing group of kind, curious, self-directed people working towards a common goal. We delight in taking risks and testing hypotheses in a collaborative and supportive environment. Our ability to celebrate both our successes and failures as milestones of growth opens the door to tremendous breakthroughs.

Computer vision and machine learning are at the core of our patent pending technology. Our accomplished team is a potent combination of technology and commerce professionals that are looking to ""Eliminate lines and save people time!""

Role Overview:

Grabango seeks an experienced backend software engineer to help design and build its distributed systems, ML/CV, and data pipelining infrastructures. In order to generate a receipt based on computer vision only, we need to have tools to process massive amounts of video and other downstream data, making decisions about real-world events at every layer of our infrastructure simultaneously. Additionally, the system doing this work needs to be able to scale horizontally, and be fault tolerant at every layer.

We are looking for a flexible, curious engineer with deep experience of high-throughput distributed systems using modern tooling and languages. Though we use many tools, depth of experience with Python and its use with distributed and real-time systems (Celery + Redis / RabbitMQ, Kafka + Faust, etc) will be central to this role. Deep working experience with the placement of different kinds of data in microservice architectures will be a critical element of this role as we work towards the infinitely scalable future. Shared tools such as Kubernetes, Docker and Git should be second-nature.

As a deeply technical lead, the ideal candidate will prefer spending about 50% of their time actually writing code, splitting the rest between planning and mentorship and code review. We are looking for an engineer who has already seen success in growing their team around them, as well as engineering highly available high-throughput distributed systems.

This full-time role reports directly to the Sr. Engineering Manager (Scale Team) and is based in Berkeley.

Reducing latency and improving reliability of our internal APIs
Collaborating on system design to optimize petabyte-scale data set management
Supporting frontend developers in expanding our labeling and management system
Within the first 6 months
Designing distributed computing infrastructure for real time data processing
Scaling computer vision algorithms to run massively parallel in production
Determining technical roadmap based on current tech maturity and business objectives

What you should have:


8+ years Python and/or C++ experience with mastery of modern language features and libraries
Depth of experience with distributed and real-time systems, infrastructure, frameworks, and datastores
Second-nature familiarity with shared tools: Kubernetes, Docker, Git
You recognize the need to balance pragmatism and creativity
You have made mistakes, learned from them and avoided making them again.
You are able to use your knowledge and experience to help solve problems that may not be in your field of expertise
You work well with a diverse team of high-quality people focused on customer delight.
You can rapidly become familiar with and apply new tools and technologies

Educations & Certifications:


BS or equivalent experience in Computer Science or Computer Engineering

Grabango Values:
Integrity: Do the right thing, particularly when you don't have to.

Bold Innovation: Think recklessly, but temper your actions with pragmatism.

People Matter: Hire the best, and treasure them.

Don't Live with Broken: Have the courage to admit mistakes, and the urgency to correct them.

Customer Focus: Deliver beyond expectations, both internally and externally.

Inclusion: Foster an environment that welcomes all.

Simplify: Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.

Grabango is proud to be an equal opportunity employer and is committed to developing a workplace where diversity and inclusion are an essential part of who we are.

Principal Software Engineer,-1,"Who we are:


Grabango is the leading provider of checkout-free shopper technology for existing stores. Founded by Will Glaser (co-founder/former CTO of Pandora Media), the Grabango team has developed the only enterprise class solution for large store chains in the market today. Grabango's system accommodates thousands of store locations, hundreds of thousands of SKUs and millions of square feet across a given retail enterprise.

We're a growing group of kind, curious, self-directed people working towards a common goal. We delight in taking risks and testing hypotheses in a collaborative and supportive environment. Our ability to celebrate both our successes and failures as milestones of growth opens the door to tremendous breakthroughs.

Computer vision and machine learning are at the core of our patent pending technology. Our accomplished team is a potent combination of technology and commerce professionals that are looking to ""Eliminate lines and save people time!""

Role Overview:

Grabango seeks an experienced backend software engineer to help design and build its distributed systems, ML/CV, and data pipelining infrastructures. In order to generate a receipt based on computer vision only, we need to have tools to process massive amounts of video and other downstream data, making decisions about real-world events at every layer of our infrastructure simultaneously. Additionally, the system doing this work needs to be able to scale horizontally, and be fault tolerant at every layer.

We are looking for a flexible, curious engineer with deep experience of high-throughput distributed systems using modern tooling and languages. Though we use many tools, depth of experience with Python and its use with distributed and real-time systems (Celery + Redis / RabbitMQ, Kafka + Faust, etc) will be central to this role. Deep working experience with the placement of different kinds of data in microservice architectures will be a critical element of this role as we work towards the infinitely scalable future. Shared tools such as Kubernetes, Docker and Git should be second-nature.

As a deeply technical lead, the ideal candidate will prefer spending about 50% of their time actually writing code, splitting the rest between planning and mentorship and code review. We are looking for an engineer who has already seen success in growing their team around them, as well as engineering highly available high-throughput distributed systems.

This full-time role reports directly to the Sr. Engineering Manager (Scale Team) and is based in Berkeley.

What you'll be doing:


Within the first 3 months
Getting up to speed on our various systems
Expanding our data pipeline across multiple networks
Instrumenting code to help us find areas to improve our designs
Working with other developers to identify and resolve bugs
Reducing latency and improving reliability of our internal APIs
Collaborating on system design to optimize petabyte-scale data set management
Supporting frontend developers in expanding our labeling and management system
Within the first 6 months
Designing distributed computing infrastructure for real time data processing
Scaling computer vision algorithms to run massively parallel in production
Determining technical roadmap based on current tech maturity and business objectives

What you should have:


8+ years Python and/or C++ experience with mastery of modern language features and libraries
Depth of experience with distributed and real-time systems, infrastructure, frameworks, and datastores
Second-nature familiarity with shared tools: Kubernetes, Docker, Git
You recognize the need to balance pragmatism and creativity
You have made mistakes, learned from them and avoided making them again.
You are able to use your knowledge and experience to help solve problems that may not be in your field of expertise
You work well with a diverse team of high-quality people focused on customer delight.
You can rapidly become familiar with and apply new tools and technologies

Educations & Certifications:


BS or equivalent experience in Computer Science or Computer Engineering

Grabango Values:
Integrity: Do the right thing, particularly when you don't have to.

Bold Innovation: Think recklessly, but temper your actions with pragmatism.

People Matter: Hire the best, and treasure them.

Don't Live with Broken: Have the courage to admit mistakes, and the urgency to correct them.

Customer Focus: Deliver beyond expectations, both internally and externally.

Inclusion: Foster an environment that welcomes all.

Simplify: Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.

Grabango is proud to be an equal opportunity employer and is committed to developing a workplace where diversity and inclusion are an essential part of who we are. We strive to hire and support a workforce as diverse as our shopper base, so we can develop products and services that best suit our customers.

And we are known for practicing what we preach.

We want the people who care about doing a good job. The ones who have the humility and hunger to learn. - Sam Kroonenburg, Co-Founder and CEO

More than a job


Where you work isn't just a career decision -- it's a life decision. We get it. That's why we want all of our Gurus to feel a sense of belonging that comes from feeling supported in all areas of their lives. Everyone has family, friends and interests outside of their careers, so we offer perks and benefits to make work, work better for you.
4 weeks PTO, plus 10 sick days, and holidays. Whether it's hiking to a waterfall in Costa Rica or bonding with your couch, we all need downtime. All Gurus get four weeks paid time off, 10 sick days, and enough holiday to make a banker blush.
Let's get lunch. Lunches are catered three times per week, and our kitchen stays stocked with a smorgasbord of the team's most requested snacks and drinks.
Parking is on us. We have your Downtown parking covered. We offer paid garage parking nearby the office. We also have perks for going green by walking and taking public transit.
We've got you covered. We offer insurance plans that pay for 100% of your medical, dental, and vision, and 80% for your family/dependents.
Gender-neutral paid parental leave. Expanding your family? We offer 12 weeks of gender-neutral paid parental leave, and reimburse up to $10,000 for eligible adoption expenses.
$1,000 continuing education budget. All Gurus get $250 a quarter to spend on personal development, and 2 hours each week reserved for learning something new.
Remote where?


The A Cloud Guru team has grown a lot since it was just two brothers with a dream of teaching the world to cloud! We now employ gurus in 30 states of the USA as well as in Australia and the UK. For the time being that's as far as we can go. We won't bore you with the details, but setting up the extra operations we would need to employ people in new states or countries is a little bit more expensive than replicating your database in another AZ, if you know what we mean. So as much as we would love to have staff in as many countries as we have students, we are only opening this role to applicants in areas we currently have operations.

If you're not sure if your US state is included, please still apply! We will let you know if you are in a state that we currently don't have operations. If anything changes we will reach back out.

What's the interview process like at ACG?


Applying for a job can feel intimidating and like a full-time job of its own. You shouldn't have to burn through a week of sick time or all your best out-of-office excuses just to put feelers out for a new career opportunity. We want to be as transparent about the process as possible to help ease your mind. It's our goal to provide you a fair, efficient interviewing experience that respects you and your time and to do it all with a sidecar of delight.

Once you submit an application, we'll review it. If you're a good fit, you'll have an initial chat with a recruiter over the phone. A phone interview with a manager typically follows. Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). Then we'll schedule a Zoom call to meet other members of the team, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it's really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.

"Senior Software Engineer (Frontend), Imaging, Science",-1,"Founded by Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg in 2015, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) is a new kind of philanthropy that's leveraging technology to help solve some of the world's toughest challenges – from eradicating disease, to improving education, to reforming the criminal justice system. Our mission is to create a future for everyone. Across our three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.

Our Values


We believe we can help build a future for everyone.
We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.
Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

The Opportunity


By pairing engineers with leaders in our education, science, and justice and opportunity teams, we can bring technology to the table in new ways to help drive solutions. We are uniquely positioned to design, build, and scale software systems to help educators, scientists, and policy experts better address the myriad challenges they face.

In our Science Initiative, our mission is to support science and technology that will help make it possible to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. Interdisciplinary teams of physicians, biologists, computational scientists, and engineers can expand our understanding of the human body and illness — the very science behind medicine. CZI fosters collaboration between scientists and engineers, develops tools and technologies, and builds support for basic scientific research.

Some Science Initiative example projects include:
napari - an open-source interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for python
IDseq - a metagenomics platform focused on delivering insights in infectious disease
Starfish - an open-source image processing framework, enabling access to multiplex image-based transcriptomics analysis
cellxgene - an open-source interactive data explorer for single-cell transcriptomics data
Meta, a semantic discovery tool that provides a faster way to understand, organize and explore science through personalized feeds
As a Senior Software Engineer in the Imaging Program, you will build software tools to support our mission, focused on enabling researchers to gain a much deeper mechanistic understanding of biological systems. Those software tools will help researchers to visualize life's processes at the necessary biological scales (systems, tissues, cells, proteins) and in the necessary context (e.g. protein interaction in cells, cell signaling in the living system), enable measurement and quantitative insights, and make and build on each other's discoveries.

You will have the opportunity to work closely with a collaborative team of scientists, engineers, product managers, designers and user researchers, building software that accelerates the pace of the biological sciences. This is an excellent opportunity for a person with extraordinary engineering skills and an interest in open source software and science.

You will
Build analysis and visualization tools for exploring and analyzing biological imaging data
Collaborate on open source software projects with the opportunity to contribute to major existing essential open source projects
Work in a multi-disciplinary team, with engineers, scientists, product managers, designers and user researchers, to define product plans and strategy
You have

Comfortable developing full-stack web applications
Committed to owning the quality of your output
Like delivering software through automated testing and agile methodologies
Experience supporting a high-availability SaaS production environment
Appreciate growing technically and as an individual through feedback from mentors and peers
Even better if...
You are passionate about software security, and have dealt with the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities
You have worked with network-level protocols, and network architecture
You stay up-to-date on the latest security threats facing organizations
You build tools with usability in mind, so your work can benefit a wide audience

This job may not be for you if:
You only code alone and aren't willing to mentor and be mentored.
You lack a real passion for writing high-quality secure software that is backed by an equally mature approach to testing.
You stress under the ambiguity of a problem and default to others to provide you with the answers.
Your first instinct is to point out why something can't be done rather than focusing on what the customer problem is.
You tire at the thought of a steady, deliberate pace in both a product and company.
A couple reasons you should apply…
You love collaborating with, teaching, and learning from high-performing peers inventing a new network security product
You work best in teams of high-performers rallying around achieving a common goal
Excited? So are we! We can't wait to hear from you!

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",4.2,"Cisco Systems

You should
Be passionate about the software you build, and the way that you build it. We’re a small, high-output, largely self-directed team that prides itself on both the quality of the code we produce and on our commitment to improving our processes along the way.
Be opinionated enough to speak up when you think we could be doing something better than we’re doing it now -- and tactful and empathetic enough to communicate this in a way that brings people along instead of distancing them.
Be curious enough to try new approaches to problems, in code, architecture, and organizational matters. Don’t be afraid to try something that doesn’t work, or doesn’t work as well as you might like - but also know when to quit.
Be self-directed enough to seek out and understand not just the ‘what’ of what we’re building, but also the reason we’re building it - who is it for, how does it help them - and be informed by this knowledge to make your own decisions, large and small.
Be a proactive communicator - both to teammates and our collaborators from other engineering teams, product, customer support, sales, you get the picture. Our work impacts a lot of people, and there are a lot of stakeholders who need to maintain context alongside us as progress / decisions are made.
Be practical enough to strike a balance between doing things ‘perfectly’ and doing things ‘well enough to ship’. That is, you should know what an ideal project or application looks like, and also know when diminishing returns get in the way of bringing a better experience to our users.
Be well-versed in understanding large feature requests and breaking them down into smaller, more manageable chunks of independently shippable work - and helping to organize the team to collaborate on working together or in parallel to get them done.
Qualifications
7+ years professional software engineering experience, at least 4 years working with modern JavaScript frameworks (we use React) developing scalable, performant applications
Be well-versed in best practices in writing efficient, understandable CSS and accessible, standards-compliant HTML.
Understand frontend performance
Familiarity with current frontend build systems (Webpack, Rollup)
Well-versed in writing and running unit- and integration tests
Using Git as part of a collaborative team, including branching, pull request, and code review processes.
Accustomed to iterative development practices - breaking problems down, shipping small pieces rather than long-running features, etc.
Nice to haves
Specific experience working with web visualization of non-HTML documents (pdf.js or canvas-based document viewers)
Specific experience developing add-ons for G-suite or Office applications
Experience working full-stack in one or more server-side technologies, preferably to develop APIs. Our edge service[s] are mostly written in Java/Spring Boot.
Browser-driven end-to-end testing using a tool like Selenium or Capybara-webkit, and/or frameworks that operate on top of them (we currently use Nightwatch).
Working with containers in development and/or deployment contexts
Experience working in distributed / microservices environment
Automation (Jenkins or other CI/CD)
Experience working with Typescript, bonus points for experience transitioning plain JavaScript applications to strong typing

Staff Front End Engineer,-1,"Have you ever tried to hire a plumber? How about a house cleaner? If you have, chances are it took you way longer than it should. In the era of instant-everything, you shouldn't have to waste an entire afternoon researching, calling and vetting local service professionals whenever you need one. The market for hiring them is huge — $1 trillion in the US alone — but the process is inefficient and largely offline.

Thumbtack is transforming this experience end-to-end, building a marketplace that matches millions of people with local pros for almost any project. In making these connections, not only do our customers get more done every day, our pros are able to grow their businesses and make a living doing what they're great at.

These customers and pros come from all walks of life and every zip code in the country. We want our team to reflect that. If you come from an underrepresented background in tech, we strongly encourage you to apply. We challenge ourselves every day to make this a place where you can thrive just the way you are, so we can build a product that does the same for our customers and pros.

This position can be in-office in New York City or work-from-home. Remote U.S. candidates encouraged to apply.

This Software Engineer role is focused on the development and optimization of systems and tools we use to operate our business. These processes include but are not limited to those used to acquire, onboard, integrate with, manage, and support our customers. Given the broad scope of this effort, a successful candidate must be driven by understanding and improving work processes and developing solutions that potentially use a wide variety of technologies. For example, some solutions may involve extending or developing a web-based application using Angular and node.js, while other solutions may involve the integration of enterprise systems using golang, python, or some other language and technology stack. We are treating this effort as we treat all of our product development efforts, using agile methods to deliver incremental value to the business.

Skills and Experience
While we do not fixate on number of years of experience, we expect it will take at least 5 years doing professional software development on internal tools, enterprise platforms, or similar systems to excel in this role.
Full-stack web development, meaning use of front-end frameworks like Angular, and development of back-end services in node.js, potentially integrating with persistent stores like postgresql.

Experience and passion for developing business-critical solutions for an internal user base.
Qualities

Beyond experience in a software engineering role, we focus on the qualities we feel are important to success on our team. These include:
Proactive/Follows through--opportunities for work optimization may not always be fully formed or completely spelled out. You need to take the lead on conceiving solutions and seeing them through to delivery and actual usage.
Communication, especially cross-functionally--you will be working on internal systems used by a variety of people doing very different kinds of work and being adept at communication will be key.
Enjoys improving processes and workflows--this is the essence of this role. More than interest in any specific technology, you must be driven by optimizing work.
Adaptable/Flexible--decisions about where to apply technology are based on ROI calculations, and that could lead to changes in direction as new opportunities are discovered. An agile mindset is key.
Versatile, especially with technologies; a tinkerer--the variety of software you develop could run a wide gamut, so you need to excel at taking on new challenges outside your comfort zone.
Curious, likes to explore alternatives--understanding your users and the work they do should be compelling to you. You want to wear their shoes and think about different ways to tackle their work.
Pragmatic--delivering value quickly and incrementally is favored over longer efforts that defer value delivery. You get things done quickly and learn from experience.
Resourceful--sometimes the best solutions involve leveraging a variety of resources already in play, or researching how others solve similar problems.
Open minded--some problems may seem impossibly challenging, or the solution might not be obvious. Being open minded to explore options is important here.
Driven--your desire to help others and optimize solutions is intrinsic and second nature to you.

164,Software Engineer,-1,"A BIT ABOUT US
Lever was founded eight years ago to tackle the most strategic challenge that companies face: how to recruit and hire top talent. We’re building the next generation of hiring software that companies like Netflix, Cirque du Soleil, Shopify, and Eventbrite rely on to grow their teams. We've rethought the talent acquisition paradigm and are the innovation leaders in our space and looking for the right people to join us as we scale.

We’re extraordinarily proud of the company we’ve built so far (not to mention humbled to be recognized as the #1 place to work in San Francisco, as well as a top workplace in the entire United States). Our people are Lever’s biggest competitive advantage and we’ll continue investing in our “Leveroos” and people-first culture.

THE OPPORTUNITY
As an Engineer on our Product team, you’ll help us build out our core product by developing high-impact, user-facing features. In our growing engineering organization, you’ll be developing and shipping new features and updates to Lever’s product. You’ll be learning about our real-time web stack UI frameworks that help us deliver a beautiful and high quality solution to our customers. You’ll work collaboratively with product managers and designers to drive the implementation and release of major features, and be a champion of best practices for writing well-tested, well-organized code.

You’ll become familiar with all parts of our stack—including our open source web framework, DerbyJS. You will exercise judgment in making tradeoffs between design and feasibility. You’ll engineer your features to be scalable and resilient in a complex, single-page application.

We believe that user-centric design ultimately leads to the best products, so we listen closely to our users, both external and internal. As an engineer on our close-knit, cross-functional team, you’ll be an active voice in shaping our product. Lever is constantly rolling out high-demand features and tackling ever greater challenges of scale.

THE TEAM
You’ll join a team where everyone—including you—is striving to constantly improve their knowledge of infrastructure, systems, and cares about minimizing downtime. We are an incredibly supportive team–we love to pitch in when problems arise and give great peer feedback to help each other grow. We are passionate about lots of things--automation, friendly chat bots, creating a great hiring experience, and a great user experience--and we love sharing those passions with each other.

Read about what our team values and why here.

THE TECH STACK
Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

We're looking to hire a backend engineer to build data-driven services that provide value directly to customers and across our organization. Censys operates distributed infrastructure for Internet-wide scanning, bulk DNS resolution, and X.509 certificate ingestion: your job will be to go below the surface of our data, and help us build the highest quality datasets and APIs.

At Censys, we believe in working iteratively, but we're always thinking about the big picture. We're not looking to just add more internal services. We're building a platform that enables fast development of future products, and integration with new data collection methods. You'd be great for this position if you're someone who considers not just at initial development, but ongoing maintenance and monitoring. You consider delivery and developer experience, and everything you do can be built upon in the future by others.

What You'll Do
Design and build services that power existing and future products at Censys
Architect solutions to enrich data collected from billions of network handshakes daily
Focus on writing high-quality Go, but still contribute to solutions across multiple languages (e.g. Scala and Python) and codebases

You're experienced with patterns for concurrency. We write a lot of concurrent Go (but don't expect that you've written it before)
You understand how to build and containerize applications
You're interested in solving problems, not completing tasks
You also:
Collaborate and communicate well with other engineers working on related systems
Enjoy leading technical architecture discussions and want to drive technical decisions within your team
Have strong teaching skills. Explaining complex technical concepts to other cross functional teams is no problem for you

Who are we?

We’re FarApp, a rapidly growing e-commerce automation solution company. It sounds like a lot of buzz words, but we really are growing fast and want to bring in new talented folks to help manage our rapidly expanding customer base. We hope that we can find that talent in you!

FarApp is a SAAS company who has been in business for over 15 years. In those 15 years, we’ve expanded our original codebase to over 1.5 million lines of code processing millions of operations a day. We connect to over 60 endpoints to help our customers become versatile e-commerce participants.

What will you be doing?

You’ll be diving into our code and figuring out ways to permanently solve problems that our customers either create or point out. This requires that you have a comfort with reading code in the context of a larger system without fear and that you're willing to try out and test solutions. You need to be comfortable deploying code 10 times a day into a live environment as you solve real-world problems.

You’ll also be helping to expand our product line. We add new endpoints to our service all the time, meaning that we must develop new connectors to integrate within our current system. That could mean something simple like a new logistics company, or it could be a new marketplace that has popped up that people are flocking to.

You’ll also be participating in our continuing effort to reduce our integration time. Currently, we have an average integration time for new customers of 40 days. We strongly believe we can reduce that to less than a day, maybe less than a couple of hours. We need your creative, intelligent ideas and initiative to make that happen.

We're looking for somebody who is passionate about software and is interested to start at the ground level with a company so that they can help it grow and share in its success. We hope that you're excited to make a big impact because you'll have plenty of opportunities to do that. We don't need somebody with a lot of experience but just need somebody who can learn new technologies quickly and is excited to make learning part of their regular routine.

Cool things:

Competitive salary with great benefits

Working from home! We’re evil and make you work from home two days a week!

We offer health, dental and vision plans.

We have a 401k plan.

Bi-monthly catered lunches and office snacks.

Bi-annual raises and performance-based bonuses.

Monthly company outings

Things you need (requirements):
BS Degree in Computer Science or related field
Knowledge in Python, Flask, TurboGears, AngularJS is a plus
Experience with eCommerce marketplaces and/or platforms and APIs is a plus
We're recruiting for applicants at levels of experience who are passionate about solving problems.

Equipped with world-class, custom care delivery technology, we deliver personalized primary care, behavioral health, and social services to deliver a radically better experience of care for every member and community we serve.

Over the next year, we'll grow quickly to bring better care to many more members and their communities. We will get started in new markets, each with their own operating structure and care teams, and continue to grow in the communities where we are working already. To do this, we need people who, like us, believe that everyone should have good care for what matters to them, in their community.

Our work is grounded in a belief in the power of a diverse community. To deliver a radically better experience of care to our members and advance equity in the communities we serve, we strive to make our own team diverse and inclusive. Our ways of working are characterized by creativity, collaboration, and mutual learning that comes from bridging together a community from diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

The (quality) doctor is in.
Modio has streamlined the convoluted and messy process that is healthcare credentialing and saved countless years of manual and error-prone work in the process. As part of CHG Healthcare we are working to drastically improve the speed (and quality) of credentialing to ensure that our doctors can spend more time treating (millions) of patients each year and less time dealing with credentialing headaches.
Our industry is growing and demand is high. This means you’ll have plenty of opportunities to grow and develop in your career. Keeping healthcare healthy can be as fun as it is rewarding.
We are open to this role being in our offices in Salt Lake City, Utah or San Francisco, California.
Your role:

You understand how to design software and systems that are maintainable, robust, easy to understand, and capable of scaling. You also know that not every solution needs to be over-engineered.
You should be able to debug technical issues, even if the issue isn’t from “your code” or “your system”.
You don’t reinvent the wheel every time you build something new.
You can explain complex ideas in plain and simple language (most of the time).
Your qualifications:
5+ years’ experience as a site reliability engineer (or equivalent). Must understand things like caching, web scraping, exponential backoff, serverless, and rate limiting.
Professional experience working on backend API code (Node.js/TypeScript Preferred but not a hard requirement). Familiarity with defensive coding practices a must!
Experience working with serverless functions.
Experience with application metrics using StatsD/Prometheus/etc.
Experience managing on-call rotations and responding to support incidents.
Experience with container technologies such as Docker or Kubernetes.

About Us: *
CareAdvisors is a technology company helping patients get access to healthcare and the social service benefits they need by automating the manual enrollment burden taken on by hospitals.

Many patients who receive care at hospitals are eligible for Medicaid and other social service benefits, but have barriers to enroll or re-enroll in their benefits. Using a modern technology stack focused on automation, we remove those barriers so that patients can get access to the benefits they need, and lift the financial burden hospitals endure when providing care to patients.

Socio-economic inequality causes health disparities between neighborhoods, which drives our mission: achieving health equity. Without adequate access to health services, food, transportation, housing, and education, upward mobility is challenging. This requires systemic change, and we want to be the unifying social service infrastructure that will empower organizations at the community level who have been serving tirelessly for decades to move the needle.

Our platform empowers care navigators and social workers with a search and communication platform that’s connected to a network of community organizations and hospitals. We use the data gathered across our network to power our automated analytics engine. Join us in building out our platform so we can connect people to the care they need!
About the Role: *
You have multiple years of solving challenging problems in small teams and now, you want to extend your range of skills to include building and managing cloud infrastructure. You are comfortable navigating an entire web tech stack and want to lead and grow a team of engineers.

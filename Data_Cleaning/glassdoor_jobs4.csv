From food to home to news and technology and more, we represent the influential voices who make the internet a better place. As the largest exclusive publisher network, with direct access to code-on-page and underlying datasets, we have a unique capability to build innovative products that span across publishers, advertisers and consumers.

This position can be in-office in New York City or work-from-home. Remote U.S. candidates encouraged to apply.

This Software Engineer role is focused on the development and optimization of systems and tools we use to operate our business. These processes include but are not limited to those used to acquire, onboard, integrate with, manage, and support our customers. Given the broad scope of this effort, a successful candidate must be driven by understanding and improving work processes and developing solutions that potentially use a wide variety of technologies. For example, some solutions may involve extending or developing a web-based application using Angular and node.js, while other solutions may involve the integration of enterprise systems using golang, python, or some other language and technology stack. We are treating this effort as we treat all of our product development efforts, using agile methods to deliver incremental value to the business.

Skills and Experience
While we do not fixate on number of years of experience, we expect it will take at least 5 years doing professional software development on internal tools, enterprise platforms, or similar systems to excel in this role.
Full-stack web development, meaning use of front-end frameworks like Angular, and development of back-end services in node.js, potentially integrating with persistent stores like postgresql.
Experience integrating with enterprise CRM systems like Salesforce.com.
Experience with building and operating software in the public cloud, specifically AWS.
Experience and passion for developing business-critical solutions for an internal user base.
Qualities

Beyond experience in a software engineering role, we focus on the qualities we feel are important to success on our team. These include:
Proactive/Follows through--opportunities for work optimization may not always be fully formed or completely spelled out. You need to take the lead on conceiving solutions and seeing them through to delivery and actual usage.
Communication, especially cross-functionally--you will be working on internal systems used by a variety of people doing very different kinds of work and being adept at communication will be key.
Enjoys improving processes and workflows--this is the essence of this role. More than interest in any specific technology, you must be driven by optimizing work.
Adaptable/Flexible--decisions about where to apply technology are based on ROI calculations, and that could lead to changes in direction as new opportunities are discovered. An agile mindset is key.
Versatile, especially with technologies; a tinkerer--the variety of software you develop could run a wide gamut, so you need to excel at taking on new challenges outside your comfort zone.
Curious, likes to explore alternatives--understanding your users and the work they do should be compelling to you. You want to wear their shoes and think about different ways to tackle their work.
Pragmatic--delivering value quickly and incrementally is favored over longer efforts that defer value delivery. You get things done quickly and learn from experience.
Resourceful--sometimes the best solutions involve leveraging a variety of resources already in play, or researching how others solve similar problems.
Open minded--some problems may seem impossibly challenging, or the solution might not be obvious. Being open minded to explore options is important here.
Driven--your desire to help others and optimize solutions is intrinsic and second nature to you.
CafeMedia is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe we are most impactful when people with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and identities come together with common purpose. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.

at the same time makes projects more efficient.

Test Products and Code

fictional testing to make sure the code works and user testing to make sure the program fulfills the

SHOTOVER Systems, headquartered in beautiful Boulder, CO, designs and builds high-end gyro-stabilized airborne cameras for blockbuster movies as well as augmented reality software and hardware solutions used by the military, television stations, and firefighters around the world.

*Job Overview: *

Our augmented reality software is deployed in hundreds of aircraft around the world and interfaces with radios, radars, direction finders, searchlights, cameras, downlinks, ethernet routers, and dozens of other systems -- with virtually EVERY SINGLE INSTALLATION being different. Different baud rates, different protocols, different serial ports, different touch screens using different drivers running on different versions of our software using different satellite imagery. Different everything. So when we need to replace a computer, or upgrade customer software… Well, it’s tough -- there are a lot of moving parts and we need to get them all correct or it’s not going to work.

Rather than have people manage this, software should. Software that you write and manage. Think rsync/git/SVN or docker/ansible/terraform. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to ensure every customer delivery is perfect -- that every DLL or shared object has the right version number, that every configuration file is correct, regardless of what software changes have been made, etc. It’s a big job, but you are up for it -- maybe you’ve held a devops position, written version control software, or have familiarity with large scale regression testing.

*Required Skills*

* C/C++, Python, Shell Scripting, familiarity with GIT/SVN

*Desired Skills*

* Linux and Windows System Administration

*

*Work Authorization: U. S. Citizenship, Permanent Residency, or other protected status under 8 U. S. C. 1324b(a)(3) is required for this position.*

*\*A background check is required as part of our hiring process. *

\*\*We are in the process of updating our name from Churchill Navigation Inc. to SHOTOVER Systems, Inc. so you may notice our website is still under the Churchill name.

Our augmented reality software is deployed in hundreds of aircraft around the world and interfaces with radios, radars, direction finders, searchlights, cameras, downlinks, ethernet routers, and dozens of other systems -- with virtually EVERY SINGLE INSTALLATION being different. Different baud rates, different protocols, different serial ports, different touch screens using different drivers running on different versions of our software using different satellite imagery. Different everything. So when we need to replace a computer, or upgrade customer software… Well, it’s tough -- there are a lot of moving parts and we need to get them all correct or it’s not going to work.

Rather than have people manage this, software should. Software that you write and manage. Think rsync/git/SVN or docker/ansible/terraform.

Software Engineer,-1,"A BIT ABOUT US
Lever was founded eight years ago to tackle the most strategic challenge that companies face: how to recruit and hire top talent. We’re building the next generation of hiring software that companies like Netflix, Cirque du Soleil, Shopify, and Eventbrite rely on to grow their teams. We've rethought the talent acquisition paradigm and are the innovation leaders in our space and looking for the right people to join us as we scale.

We’re extraordinarily proud of the company we’ve built so far (not to mention humbled to be recognized as the #1 place to work in San Francisco, as well as a top workplace in the entire United States). Our people are Lever’s biggest competitive advantage and we’ll continue investing in our “Leveroos” and people-first culture.

THE OPPORTUNITY
As an Engineer on our Product team, you’ll help us build out our core product by developing high-impact, user-facing features. In our growing engineering organization, you’ll be developing and shipping new features and updates to Lever’s product. You’ll be learning about our real-time web stack UI frameworks that help us deliver a beautiful and high quality solution to our customers. You’ll work collaboratively with product managers and designers to drive the implementation and release of major features, and be a champion of best practices for writing well-tested, well-organized code.

You’ll become familiar with all parts of our stack—including our open source web framework, DerbyJS. You will exercise judgment in making tradeoffs between design and feasibility. You’ll engineer your features to be scalable and resilient in a complex, single-page application.

We believe that user-centric design ultimately leads to the best products, so we listen closely to our users, both external and internal. As an engineer on our close-knit, cross-functional team, you’ll be an active voice in shaping our product. Lever is constantly rolling out high-demand features and tackling ever greater challenges of scale.

THE TEAM
You’ll join a team where everyone—including you—is striving to constantly improve their knowledge of infrastructure, systems, and cares about minimizing downtime. We are an incredibly supportive team–we love to pitch in when problems arise and give great peer feedback to help each other grow. We are passionate about lots of things--automation, friendly chat bots, creating a great hiring experience, and a great user experience--and we love sharing those passions with each other.

Read about what our team values and why here.

THE TECH STACK
Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

You’ll join a team where everyone—including you—is striving to constantly improve their knowledge of infrastructure, systems, and cares about minimizing downtime. We are an incredibly supportive team–we love to pitch in when problems arise and give great peer feedback to help each other grow. We are passionate about lots of things--automation, friendly chat bots, creating a great hiring experience, and a great user experience--and we love sharing those passions with each other.

Read about what our team values and why here.

THE TECH STACK
Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.

Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

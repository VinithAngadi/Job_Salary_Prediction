We’re specifically looking for people who can take ownership of some significant new feature development, as well as assist with importing electronic data for clients that are coming to us from another system, among other responsibilities.

And while experience is important, we’re above all looking for candidates with a rock solid work ethic, and the smarts (and common sense) to figure out solutions to problems they haven’t bumped into before. If that’s you, please apply!
About the Job
Our software does a LOT of different things: accounting and billing; capturing, storing, and tracking medical information; integrating with laboratories; allowing co-management of records with patients via the Patient Portal; appointment scheduling and task management; etc., etc. Our 6-person dev team is too small to split up the work between specialists, meaning that every developer must be willing and able to tackle any challenge that comes up, from SQL to PHP to Javascript and CSS. You’ll be asked to build (and take ownership) of new features, improve existing code, manage data imports, and even pitch in on technical support. We have a collegial, non-hierarchical team, and a collaborative attitude is essential.
Responsibilities
Author, maintain, and modify existing PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS source code.
Create useable and elegant front-end interfaces using frameworks and plain old Javascript.
Develop integrations with third-party software through a variety of APIs (both modern/RESTful APIs and legacy SOAP and SFTP systems). One early project may be development of an app for our existing Patient Portal!
Import electronic data into our software for clients that are coming from another electronic system.
Shepherd projects through code review, revision, UX review, beta testing, and deployment.
Assist with technical support (we all pitch in!) and otherwise with tasks as needed to help the team.
The job involves deploying updates and changes to web applications in a production environment. The ideal candidates will follow and understand best-practices, as well as how to work with legacy code-bases. And they will use that knowledge to help improve not only the product, but also our internal systems and practices. A successful candidate must hold themselves accountable to themselves, clients, and the team.
Key Skills
Successful construction of Web application projects using LAMP stack.
Comfortable with both OOP and Functional approaches to PHP programming.
Comfortable with Javascript and at least a couple of Javascript Frameworks.
Comfortable with MySQL.
Strong CSS and HTML skills.
Basic Linux and Apache configuration and management experience.
And above all, work ethic, common sense, and follow-through! You must be able to meet deadlines, multitask efficiently, and make sure that customers are happy.
It would also be nice if you…
Have experience with medical workflows and vocabulary.
Have experience with HL7 (version 2.x and 3).
Have experience with CCDA/CCR/CCD XML formats.
Have handled IT or Networking support in other positions
Education and Certifications
Formal education and certifications are a plus, but in no way required.
Compensation
Competitive compensation based on experience, plus health (includes limited vision coverage), dental, 401k, PTO/ holidays, flex work options, and bonuses.
To Apply
Please email a cover letter, resume, and contact information for 2+ professional references. We’d also love to see examples of your work. That could be code samples and/ or links to your Github account(s), Stack Overflow profile, etc.

ATOM is changing the consulting industry by blending true business acumen and technology consulting together to unlock wonders for our clients. At ATOM, a client isn’t just an organization, a client is a person. Whether we’re writing code to build a product that breaks through new revenue goals or we’re crafting a leadership+technology strategy that will redefine a company’s next-generation, we live in a world where the solutions are both wide and deep.
What Are We Looking For:
As an agency, ATOM exists to serve its client's needs and in order to best do this, we look for the most talented and experienced developers we can find. And most importantly, we’re developers too — you won’t find any detached management who have never coded here at ATOM.
What Will You Be Doing:
You’ll be a key part of a small team consisting of a few Developers, a Project Manager, a UX Lead and often the Client. You’ll be communicating with the team via Slack, email, Jira, and Zoom. The coding will usually be full stack, could be open-source or .Net, probably will involve AWS or Azure, and could be greenfield, app modernization, or adding features to legacy projects. We’ll want you to be comfortable and excited to learn new technologies, frameworks, and languages.
Essential Functions
Develop software solutions by evaluating requirements; conferring with clients and peers; studying systems flow, data models, and system integration points; considering mobile, accessibility, and usage at scale; following the software development lifecycle.

Required Education and Experience
4+ years of work experience as a Software Engineer or Software Developer, developing software in some backend language, ideally node/javascript, .Net, PHP, or Python. Frameworks like MVC for .Net, Laravel for PHP, Typescript, or Django are an excellent bonus.

3+ years developing in front-end javascript frameworks and libraries like Angular, React, Vue, or jQuery.
Aggressive problem diagnosis and creative problem-solving skills. Ability to work and thrive in a fast-paced environment, learn rapidly and master diverse web technologies and techniques.
Experience with design and architectures built for scale, speed, and security
Experience with cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure is a bonus!
BS degree in Computer Science, Engineering or relevant field is nice but not required

What We Offer
All the standard benefits: Health, Dental, Long-Term Disability, Short-Term Disability, Life Insurance and a 401k plan with a 4% company match
Flexible schedules and flexible work-from-home. We understand that sometimes life events happen and you need the flexibility to be at home or away from the office

Housable is an early-stage, software startup founded to make housing attainable for everyone. We are based in San Francisco, seeking our first Lead Full-Stack Developer. This is a hands-on role that requires a strong individual contributor who also has the skills and experience to help us build-out our development team as the company grows.

Residential construction in the US is a massive $800B annual market, but has seen very little innovation over the last century. Housable is focused on building automation systems for the entire housing development process, starting with the design, permitting and contractor bidding process. Our ultimate goal is to bring the entire home design, permitting and construction process online.

Housable has built the go-to online platform for homeowners to design, permit and build Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) across California - think garage conversions, basement apartments, and backyard homes. This development role will help to build-out our platform for the ADU housing vertical, which we intend to apply to other housing verticals (multi-family, single-family, remodels) and to expand our market beyond California to a national scale.

In this role you will have high leverage and high responsibility to help us guide the ground-up redevelopment of the back-end and front-end of our platform which thousands of homeowners rely on for their projects.

Enjoy being a generalist working on both the front-end, backend, and doing anything it takes to solve problems and deliver what users need.
Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts, to be able to build the best tools possible for them
Take pride in working on projects to successful completion involving a wide variety of technologies and systems, even if you have not worked with them before.
Can put yourself in the shoes of your users and be a steward of crafting great experiences.
You’re interested in having real leverage and delivering meaningful change to the market - deciding when practicality, and when precision, matters most.
You demonstrate a drive to think, work, and prioritize in the order of wide brushstrokes to crafty details, and are able to decide when is time for each.

About us*
We’re a small software team, with three full-time developers and two part-time. We’re working on a Rails 5.2 app that runs the company operations.

The goal is to see how you tackle a short list of features and to give us a relevant example of your work that we can discuss together.
Code discussion: We'll get on a video call where you can share your screen and walk us through the work that you did in the coding exercise.
Meet the CEO: We'll get on a call with the CEO and discuss any benefits questions you have.

Part Time Piano or Voice Teacher for Private Music Lessons,-1,"Expressions Music Academy in West Bloomfield, Rochester Hills, Plymouth-Canton, Novi, and Troy is currently interviewing piano and/or voice instructors.
The requirements are as follows: *
Preferably pursuing or obtained a university degree related to music or at least has received substantial training in piano and/or voice
Experience teaching private piano and/or voice lessons to children and adults
For voice teachers, ideally the ability to teach beginning piano
Comfortable teaching a variety of styles and genres
Planning to remain in the area and commit to this position for at least a few years
All Expressions instructors are paid a competitive hourly rate which takes into consideration all of the administrative work and resources provided by the academy. Expressions Music Academy opened its first location in Novi in 2010, a second location in Troy in January 2014, a third location in Plymouth-Canton in February 2017, and fourth and fifth locations in West Bloomfield and Rochester Hills in April 2019. Expressions is an energetic, innovative music school with a growing, friendly community of over2,000 weekly private students and 100 highly-qualified instructors across allfivelocations.

WHY MUSIC TEACHERS CHOOSE TO TEACH AT EXPRESSIONS:
A CONSTANT FLOW OF NEW STUDENTS TO KEEP SCHEDULES AS FULL AS POSSIBLE*
Over the course of the year, students can move or quit. This can leave a teacher with gaps or holes in their schedule. At our schools, we spend a lot of money on advertising and marketing year-round to keep our teachers' schedules as full as possible. We are continually registering new students for our private music lessons even during typically slower registration months like June and July.
UNLIKE internet referral services, it is in our best interest to keep your schedule full! With the other companies, they want as many teachers as possible in as many places as possible. They don't care if you only have 2 students. We have to pay for studios and it takes time and money to hire instructors. Therefore we want you to have a full schedule and succeed as a music teacher! It is far easier to support one teacher with a full schedule than it is to support 15 teachers with a couple students each. * ’ 80-95% .*
EXTRAS ARE TAKEN CARE OF – YOUR ONLY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO TEACH*
Our organized and friendly administrative and management staff handle all of the details. From scheduling to collecting fees to organizing recitals. These details are handled by our administrators, not the teacher. This means the teacher is free to focus on teaching and not get bogged down by administration or handling awkward situations in regard to tuition collection or scheduling. Driving all over town for a couple lessons, trying to remember who is months behind on tuition, and trying to protect your time against student cancellations with no pay are all problems of the past.
PAID TRAINING, ONGOING COACHING, & BONUSES PROVIDED*
Expressions is one of those rare places that actually has a vision statement which they live by and make decisions by every day. Our vision is all about growth, and we believe in fostering an environment of growth for _everyone_, teachers included. Whether you have only taught a handful of students or have been teaching for 50 years, we believe that you can grow and refine your skills at our school without being put into a box or forced to follow any certain curriculum. We have an abundance of resources and work together as a team (we actually have teacher teams) to uphold and continually raise EMA’s reputation of excellence to what it is. While we welcome all beginning students to our school, we don’t want to simply be a revolving door for them, but rather to create an environment of long-term growth where they take lessons and progress for years and years and years. We are revolutionizing the music school industry with our inspiring teacher training and incentive programs, and are always seeking teachers who are open-minded to growth and improvement.
OUR TEACHERS ARE EMPLOYEES*
Most music schools or stores hire their teachers as independent contractors to come and go. At Expressions, our teachers are part of our _family_, and so even if they only teach one day with us, they are classified as an employee, which provides many benefits in the case of seeking a car loan, home mortgage, or other applications which look more favorably upon a consistent employee job as opposed to a contractor position. Employee jobs are sometimeshard to come by for professional musicians, so we are proud to offer this benefit! Our teachers are conveniently paid via direct deposit every two weeks.
YOUR TIME IS RESPECTED AND YOU ARE PAID WHEN STUDENTS CANCEL LATE*
Our teachers are paid when students do not provide 24-hour notice. Even when they DO provide 24-hour notice, we do our best to book a make-up lesson in that spot so that you are still paid. Our teachers are very comfortable knowing how much income they will make in any given month.
NO HAVING TO COME IN FOR EXTRA MAKE-UP LESSONS*
Make-ups only occur within your regular teaching schedule; no make-ups on random days and times. Students sign up for make-up lessons over other students’ absences. This means when one of your students is absent, we turn that lesson time into an available make-up time for another student. The system is flexible for our students and families, and means you never have to worry about setting aside time outside of your regular schedule for make-ups, or teaching an unpaid make-up lesson.
USE THE MATERIALS YOU LIKE BEST*
There is no mandated school-wide curriculum or set of method books. Unlike many other music schools or stores, we are not looking to sell any merchandise or books. We trust our teachers at EMA to be experts in their fields, and encourage them to use the materials they think are best for each individual student.
WE ORDER YOUR STUDENTS’ BOOKS FOR YOU*
We take care of all book ordering and can order whatever you like for your students! So when your student needs a new book or sheet music, just fill out our quick online Material Request form, and we’ll take care of it for you and get it into your hands within a week!
STUDENT RECITALS*
All recitals are completely organized and run by EMA staff, and are offered every month. We have a beautiful concert venue in Novi and our administrative team takes care of all logistics from helping students sign up to the physical set-up/breakdown, as well as everything involved with the post-recital reception.
COMFORTABLE AND PROFESSIONAL TEACHING ENVIRONMENT*
We provide our teachers with a beautiful, comfortable, spacious teaching space. All of our locations are incredibly clean, new, and well-maintained with ample waiting room for all students, as well as large, comfortable teaching rooms. Plus, we have coffee, WIFI, and a teacher’s lounge for making copies, socializing, or taking breaks.
ALWAYS KNOW YOUR SCHEDULE WITH OUR ONLINE SCHEDULING SYSTEM*
Access your updated schedule, absences, make-ups, etc. online through our teacher app at all times. Our teacher app is incredibly easy to navigate and allows teachers to always be kept up to date on their students and schedule from home or on-the-go or wherever you are. Plus every time a student enrolls or drops or changes their schedule, you will immediately be sent an email and text notification and your schedule automatically updated.
MOTIVATE YOUR STUDENTS WITH OUR LEVEL UP PROGRAM*
Our Level Up program and app is incredibly customizable for teachers and very motivating for students. The Level Up app help keep things organized and provides an easy way for parents to see their child’s progress. If you’ve ever wanted a way to inspire students to practice harder, make more progress, and get parents on board like never before, this is it! Our students remain in lessons longer and achieve higher because of this program, which is so flexible and easy for teachers to use.
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR GIANT LIBRARY OF MUSIC*
Finding repertoire at EMA is easy. All of our teachers have access to our huge library of sheet music and song books. The contents of the library can also be viewed through our Teacher Portal from home or wherever you are, meaning you won’t have to comb through stacks of books to find what you’re looking for.
FRIENDLY COMMUNITY AND COLLABORATIVE OPPORTUNITIES*
We are constantly creating opportunities for instructors and staff to get to know one another and support one another. One of the greatest resources available at EMA is membership to a huge, friendly, chatty community of other teaching professionals. When new teachers are hired at EMA, they are placed onto a Teacher Team to make it even more fun!
RESPECT AND APPRECIATION*
Excellent teachers don’t grow on trees. We truly value and respect each one of our instructors. Feel free to ask for references from other current instructors. They love it here!

CURRENT TEACHER REVIEWS:

As a piano teacher for some thirty years now, I've found Expressions Music Academy to be an outstanding venue to do what I love to do--teach! The atmosphere is vibrant with music, and excited children of all ages and ethnicities scurry the brightly-colored, decorated halls. The support staff is friendly, competent, and efficient in handling the steady influx of new students. Their hard work allows teachers the freedom to concentrate their energies on doing what they do best. As one of the many interesting features of the Academy, students benefit from the varying styles and experiences of alternate teachers if they can't make their regularly scheduled lesson and they can even experiment with different instruments if they so choose! Regular recitals are part of the curriculum at Expressions and they take place in their very own recital hall complete with a lighted stage upon which sits a beautiful nine-foot grand piano. I love teaching at Expressions Music Academy, it's been a blessing really, and I hope to continue to do so for a very long time! - *George Lilley, Piano*

The best part about teaching at Expressions is the supportive community of staff and teachers. I have taught at several other music schools, and none of them have even come close to providing the support I have found at EMA. From lesson materials to the ease of scheduling recitals, EMA always seeks to make sure I have what I need as a teacher, so that in turn I can focus on giving my students the best experience. -*Molly Bruner, Voice and Piano*

What impressed me most about Expressions Music Academy, when I visited the school and subsequently started teaching there, was the overall feeling of the musical environment it provides for children of almost any age and adults as well. From early music classes to ukulele, Expressions provides the students and teachers with all the supplies needed for a proper music lesson including music, stands, pianos, monthly recitals to give students an opportunity to perform in front of an audience and a beautiful studio to hold the lessons in. More importantly, though, it is modeled after a university style environment to give both students and teachers an experience that is like no other I know of, except that of a university or music conservatory.

It has been such a different experience than teaching privately in my home for many reasons. I don’t have to worry about getting my name out through word of mouth or investing in any other marketing to find students who need instruction, unlike teaching privately I have the added security of being paid for my time even if a student cancels last minute and I have the benefit of other instructors who can take over in my absence. I could not be happier that I found and started at Expressions. - *Lisa Paske, Violin and Viola*

I enjoy working at Expressions because I can honestly say they focus on both student and teacher growth! Having a large supportive network of teachers is indispensable for ensuring student success. I can borrow literature, learn about new technology, and inquire about different approaches in the hallway. - *Cassie Barger, Voice, Piano, Woodwinds, Brass*

Working as a piano teacher at Expressions Music Academy has been such a great experience. I love that I get to just come in and teach. They handle all the scheduling, ordering, billing, and recital planning. I highly recommend joining our team! - *Meghan Smith, Piano*

I have been teaching at Expressions Music Academy in Novi and Troy for a number of years. During my time here I have seen Expressions grow and develop quite a bit and in a number of situations. All I can say is that I truly enjoy teaching here for a number of reasons.

First of all, the logistical issues that drive us all crazy are taken care of and you can focus on teaching and enjoying working with the students. The staff does a great job of addressing all of the scheduling, payment, cancellations, and any other non teaching issue you can imagine that comes along. In fact my favorite line when asked about this is “talk to the front desk.” It makes things so much simpler.

The next reason would have to be the facilities. The rooms at Expressions are nicer and larger than most places I have taught. It is nice not to be teaching in a closet. I also love the fact that we have access to all of the office supplies that we might need and a desk to sit at while working. In fact it is common for me to come in early to plan and organize before I start teaching, and when that is complete it is nice to practice and warm up before your lessons.

Colleagues are another important factor in my opinion since I hate dealing with all of the social politics of just about everything. My colleagues at Expressions are great, and many times will have some interesting discussions in between lessons. - *Jeff Wiles, Woodwinds*

Expressions has allowed me to discover the passion I have for teaching students one-on-one. The Academy setting allows for teachers to focus on what we do best and the support staff go above and beyond to recruit new students and keep the current ones happy and excited to be a part of such a wonderful community. My schedule is consistently full with over 50 students of all different ages and skill levels. Expressions is truly a fantastic place to teach, come join us!!!! - *Jessica King, Violin, Viola, Piano*

"Software Engineer, Internal Systems",-1,"CafeMedia empowers over 2,800 premium publishers, with a collective reach of over 164MM monthly unique visitors (#12 largest Comscore property in August 2020), to make a living doing what they love producing great content while we manage the advertising for them. From food to home to news and technology and more, we represent the influential voices who make the internet a better place. As the largest exclusive publisher network, with direct access to code-on-page and underlying datasets, we have a unique capability to build innovative products that span across publishers, advertisers and consumers.

This position can be in-office in New York City or work-from-home. Remote U.S. candidates encouraged to apply.

This Software Engineer role is focused on the development and optimization of systems and tools we use to operate our business. These processes include but are not limited to those used to acquire, onboard, integrate with, manage, and support our customers. Given the broad scope of this effort, a successful candidate must be driven by understanding and improving work processes and developing solutions that potentially use a wide variety of technologies. For example, some solutions may involve extending or developing a web-based application using Angular and node.js, while other solutions may involve the integration of enterprise systems using golang, python, or some other language and technology stack. We are treating this effort as we treat all of our product development efforts, using agile methods to deliver incremental value to the business.

Skills and Experience
While we do not fixate on number of years of experience, we expect it will take at least 5 years doing professional software development on internal tools, enterprise platforms, or similar systems to excel in this role.
Full-stack web development, meaning use of front-end frameworks like Angular, and development of back-end services in node.js, potentially integrating with persistent stores like postgresql.
Experience integrating with enterprise CRM systems like Salesforce.com.
Experience with building and operating software in the public cloud, specifically AWS.
Experience and passion for developing business-critical solutions for an internal user base.
Qualities

Beyond experience in a software engineering role, we focus on the qualities we feel are important to success on our team. These include:
Proactive/Follows through--opportunities for work optimization may not always be fully formed or completely spelled out. You need to take the lead on conceiving solutions and seeing them through to delivery and actual usage.
Communication, especially cross-functionally--you will be working on internal systems used by a variety of people doing very different kinds of work and being adept at communication will be key.
Enjoys improving processes and workflows--this is the essence of this role. More than interest in any specific technology, you must be driven by optimizing work.
Adaptable/Flexible--decisions about where to apply technology are based on ROI calculations, and that could lead to changes in direction as new opportunities are discovered. An agile mindset is key.
Versatile, especially with technologies; a tinkerer--the variety of software you develop could run a wide gamut, so you need to excel at taking on new challenges outside your comfort zone.
Curious, likes to explore alternatives--understanding your users and the work they do should be compelling to you. You want to wear their shoes and think about different ways to tackle their work.
Pragmatic--delivering value quickly and incrementally is favored over longer efforts that defer value delivery. You get things done quickly and learn from experience.
Resourceful--sometimes the best solutions involve leveraging a variety of resources already in play, or researching how others solve similar problems.
Open minded--some problems may seem impossibly challenging, or the solution might not be obvious. Being open minded to explore options is important here.
Driven--your desire to help others and optimize solutions is intrinsic and second nature to you.
CafeMedia is committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe we are most impactful when people with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences, and identities come together with common purpose. We encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.

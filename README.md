# Job_Salary_Prediction
Our project aims to assist job seekers negotiate salaries by predicting what salary to expect for a certain job description at a given location. There are tens of thousands of jobs on online job boards that invite job seekers to apply for jobs without providing an estimate of the compensation they provide â€“ this was further validated when we were scraping for salaries online. This poses a lot of problems for job seekers, especially new graduates like us, applying for a job role or when trying to negotiate the compensation. These problems are what we seek to solve in our project, where we train machine learning models to predict salaries for a job posting at a certain location in the United States. We, being job seekers, are facing this problem every day in our job hunt which gives us a strong motivation to build an efficient and reliable model to help us in finding the right compensation for our jobs.

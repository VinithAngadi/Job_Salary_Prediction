# Job Salary Prediction

### Overview
Our project aims to assist job seekers negotiate salaries by predicting what salary to expect for a certain job description at a given location. There are tens of thousands of jobs on online job boards that invite job seekers to apply for jobs without providing an estimate of the compensation they provide â€“ this was further validated when we were scraping for salaries online. This poses a lot of problems for job seekers, especially new graduates like us, applying for a job role or when trying to negotiate the compensation. These problems are what we seek to solve in our project, where we train machine learning models to predict salaries for a job posting at a certain location in the United States. We, being job seekers, are facing this problem every day in our job hunt which gives us a strong motivation to build an efficient and reliable model to help us in finding the right compensation for our jobs.

### Description of files
- `scraper.py` - Scrapes the data from indeed.com
- `cleaning_data.py` - Loads the unclean data and performs all text cleaning and transformation
- `modelling.py` - Loads cleaned data with tfidf and topic modelling results, tests various machine learning models with their statistical significance
- App: Contains HTML files and `app.py` file  which implements Flask & Plotly to create the web app
- Data: Contains CSV files of data and `vocab.txt` - Contains the 7000 skills of vocabulary for tfidf vectorization 
- Model: Contains the Machine Learning Pipeline python script file to perform all the training and testing of the data using Gradient boosting (our final model)

# Job Salary Prediction
Our project aims to assist job seekers negotiate salaries by predicting what salary to expect for a certain job description at a given location. There are tens of thousands of jobs on online job boards that invite job seekers to apply for jobs without providing an estimate of the compensation they provide â€“ this was further validated when we were scraping for salaries online. This poses a lot of problems for job seekers, especially new graduates like us, applying for a job role or when trying to negotiate the compensation. These problems are what we seek to solve in our project, where we train machine learning models to predict salaries for a job posting at a certain location in the United States. We, being job seekers, are facing this problem every day in our job hunt which gives us a strong motivation to build an efficient and reliable model to help us in finding the right compensation for our jobs.

### Overview
This project contains a web app that asks for a message from a potential user who is in danger during a disaster and the app categorizes that message into a particular category such as aid related, weather related, fire or many more.

### Description of files
- App: Contains javascript files and `app.py` file  which implements Flask & Plotly to create the web app
- Data: Contains two CSV files `disaster_messages.csv` - Contains all the past messages & 'disaster_categories.csv' - contains the categories of the disaster messages
- Model: Contains the Machine Learning Pipeline python script file to perform all the training and testing of the data

### List of Python libraries used
`nltk`
`sklearn`
`numpy`
`pandas`
`sys`
`sqlalchemy`
`re`
`pickle`
`json`
`flask`

### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/

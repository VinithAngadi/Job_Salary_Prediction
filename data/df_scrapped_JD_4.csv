Summary
This position is located at the Portland VA Medical Center. The incumbent works within the inpatient and Emergency Services Division (IESD). The incumbent will have responsibility for development, organization, management and application of information systems for the clinical and administrative activities within IESD.
Responsibilities
This position involves a multi-grade career ladder. The major duties listed below represent the full performance level of GS-12, however a selection can be made at any of the following grade levels: GS-11 or GS-12.. At the GS11 grade level, you will perform assignments of a more limited scope and with less independence. You will progressively acquire the background necessary to perform at the full performance level of GS-12. Promotion is at the discretion of the supervisor and is contingent upon satisfactory performance, availability of higher-level work, and availability of funds.

Major Duties include but are not limited to:
Within the current health care environment of the Veteran Health Administration (VHA), the
broad focus is on three key elements: information-based decision-making through data analysis;
excellence in clinical practice and patient satisfaction, and efficient resources utilization and
management. The goal of informatics will be the development and management of data
systems assisting managers in understanding this complex care system and creating the basis
for data-driven decision-making for performance management. The incumbent will clearly
understand the array of informational and data systems available through local and national
sources.
The innate value of informational systems and information modeling is its ability to simplify large
data-sets or complex situations into more understandable terms or concepts allowing rational
decision-making principles to guide the organization within an increasingly competitive
marketplace of the healthcare environment. The objective of data-driven decision modeling will
seek the most efficient operational or policy alternatives merging statistical models with cost based
analyses. Efficiency management, in this context, means quality at the lowest overall
operation or practice cost, and not simply lowest cost alternative. The incumbent will understand
the clinical programs; clinical practice models, medical center & VA operational systems, and
resource utilization and/or cost accounting systems in order to create information streams
incorporating aggregate cost analysis against current operational models or options.

Another key component of the resources management will be workload capture for the service.
The incumbent will manage all workload capture systems assuring all visits, procedures,
consultations and other forms of workload are completed in the appropriate timeframes. The
incumbent will also develop workload descriptive assessments with trend data or forecasting
information to analyze workload and resource levels to meet current and the future demand.

The incumbent will be expected to aggregate data sets using appropriate statistical analyses of
current clinical operations and clinical practice patterns. This is an important component of the
position. Clinical practice models of the private sector drive the resource allocation model of the
VA and medical center. The practice patterns of the individual provider and the aggregate
practice of general and subspecialty groups drive the cost of our service-level practice. In an era
of diminishing budget allocations and increased dependence on non-appropriated revenue streams,
the understanding of practice patterns and alternatives is essential to survival. The
incumbent will be expected to aggregate and analyze clinical practice information to assess
such activities as drug utilization patterns, case-mix analysis, patient referral patterns,
consultation utilization patterns, and productivity models based on case-mix complexities. The
incumbent will also integrate data into meaningful group or sub-set information analyses such
as, but not limited to, hospital admissions patterns, length of stay, bed days of care and
pharmacy and medication use practices and patterns.

Promotion Potential: The selectee may be promoted to the full performance level without further competition when all regulatory, qualification, and performance requirements are met. Selection at a lower grade level does not guarantee promotion to the full performance level.

We achieve these vital missions through a diverse workforce spanning hundreds of occupations. Make an impact; join DHS.
When disaster strikes, America looks to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Now FEMA looks to you. Join our team and use your talent to support Americans in their times of greatest need.

How You Will Be Evaluated
You will be evaluated for this job based on how well you meet the qualifications above.
We use a multi-step process to review and evaluate applicants:

1. Eligibility and Minimum Qualifications
Once the vacancy announcement closes, we will review your submitted resume and documents to determine if you meet the eligibility and minimum qualification requirements, including any required education, experience, and/or selective placement factors. You will be rated as ineligible if you do not meet U.S. Citizenship requirements or your application is missing any required documents. You will be rated as not qualified if you do not possess the minimum qualification requirements.

2. Rating and Ranking
If you are found to meet both the eligibility and minimum qualification requirements, we will assess the quality of your experience and the extent to which you possess the required KSAs by comparing your submitted resume and documents against your responses to the occupational questionnaire. (The occupational questionnaire is the list of questions in the automated system that you will have an opportunity to answer once you apply for the position).

Based on the outcome of this evaluation, you will be placed into one of three categories: Best Qualified, Well Qualified, or Qualified.

If your responses to the occupational questionnaire are not substantiated by your submitted resume, you may be eliminated from receiving further consideration.

Veterans’ Preference: Veterans’ preference eligibles will be ranked ahead of qualified non-preference eligibles within each category for which they are qualified. Qualified veterans’ preference eligibles with a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more (CPS and CP) will be placed at the top of the Best Qualified category, except in the case of scientific or professional positions at the GS-9 grade level or higher.

3. Referral and Selection
If you are found to be amongst the most highly qualified applicants, you will be referred to the selecting official. As part of the assessment and selection process, the selecting official may invite you to participate in a structured interview, check your references, and/or request that you submit a writing sample or complete a written assessment or exercise to further evaluate your qualifications for this position.

Preparing statistical reports, forecasting reports and historical data charts for management use within the Applicant Services Section.

The solar industry is different. During this time, most people are looking for ways to save money. Our unique solar product costs our customers nothing to start and will save them 20-40% every month on their electricity bill without any debt to their name. We are hiring and need to fill this role quickly.***
Your Role:
At Solnova Solar, you will work directly with senior sales reps within the company. This role is crucial. The role is primarily created to help senior sales reps hit their quotas. You will be prospecting along with the senior sales reps but will not be required to close any sales. If you have been in sales awhile, starting a new role where you are required to manage the full sales cycle, can be overwhelming. This takes the pressure off of you because you can rely on experienced and competent reps to close. Sales Assistants that excel in this role will be given opportunities to advance out of this role after a period of time.
Why Solnova is different:
We all can agree that sales is the greatest profession in the world. You truly can make what you are worth. However, just because you enjoy sales, doesn't mean you've found the right product or company to sell for.
Most people are looking for a change in their sales career for one of the following reasons:
1. Your current company isn't giving you opportunities for advancement or long term benefits.
2. You're currently not making what you want to be making financially.
3. You're not able to maintain a healthy work/life balance.
Which one is it for you?
At Solnova, we can help you check all three of these boxes!
1. You will be trained from the best and given all the resources needed to be successful. We have been in business for 8 years and have built successful offices in 5 different markets and are now focusing our efforts to quickly expand in the DFW market. If you prove yourself, management and growth opportunities will be made available.
2. Reps have unlimited earning potential. Your hard work deserves to be rewarded. Average reps in our training program make $1000-$1500 per week. Once training is completed, average reps will earn $1500-$5000 per week. Top earners at Solnova earn seven figures a year.
3. Reps have a great work/life balance. To help keep you energized and motivated, we offer flexible work arrangements. Plan on 35-40 hours per week.
We know this job is not for everyone. We are looking for a very specific type of individual. Successful reps will be motivated and driven. They are positive and think big. If this fits your description and if you are looking to take your career in a new direction or continue your path in sales, this is the place for you.
Job Responsibilities
Develop contact with potential customers in the industry by cold calling, networking, canvassing, emailing, or scheduling meetings in person.
Form new relationships with companies in the customer database by visiting them in person, maintaining phone contact and addressing issues or problems when they come up.
Maintain a strong understanding about product inventory, features and technical specifications to answer specific customer questions.
Present information about company offerings during trade shows or other large events to potential customers.
Salary: $60,000.00 – $255,000.00 per year

If you have a passion for sales, and the notion of working as an Inbound Call Center Representative sounds intriguing, keep reading. We’re on a quest for someone whose work as a sales consultant can help us keep our customers smiling, while supporting other Cox team members through training and mentorship.

You must live within the area of Hampton Roads, VA where Cox Communications services are available and be willing to commute when appropriate to the office due to technical or performance needs. To qualify, you must also have a high-speed internet connection available in your home.
NOTE: There could be a live video interview required during our recruitment process.
What You’ll Do
You’ll make residential customers feel “at home” with our products and services. That means being an Einstein about everything we offer as well as a whiz around the marketing campaigns that fuel those inbound calls.
This is a quota, commission-based gig, so your earnings are in your hands. One way to do this will be to be super responsive to customer inquiries, resolving issues lickety-split, all while keeping callers in-the-know about the latest solutions we have to offer.
Keep your coach cap handy, because you’ll also guide Customer Service Reps so they can confidently support the sales team, understand technical issues, and even navigate their own career paths. You’ll also pick up the phone to support other departments with overflow calls, and handle some of the more challenging customer calls yourself.
What’s In It For You?
You’ll be sold on Cox’s great, highly competitive pay, generous incentives, and other compensation perks (401k + company matching, comprehensive medical benefits, etc.). We also offer tuition reimbursement for academic pursuits, adoption assistance, paid time off to volunteer, childcare and eldercare resources, pet insurance and much more.

In the future, you may have the opportunity to cultivate your rainmaking sales skills in other sectors where we operate like cleantech, health care and new forms of transportation mobility.
Who You Are
You’re someone who anticipates customers’ needs so you can not only offer them what they need now, but also what they’ll need next. But your idea of being a “selling machine” isn’t about pushing products, it’s about listening, and fitting a customer to the solution that works best for them. People tell you you’re a good listener, and you bring that rare gift into your workplace, leading to a remarkable response reflex.
You resolve issues like a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, and understand that, despite the “flying solo” nature of remote sales work, you’re also a proud member of a tight-knit team. Relationships come easy to you, and you’re not afraid of change, computers, or clowns. Eh, maybe not the clowns.
Others look to you for leadership, guidance, and support when needed.
Qualifications:

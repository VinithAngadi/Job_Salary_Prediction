The engineer performs audits and inspections of worksites to assure compliance, prepares reports and findings, devises solutions, and implements corrective actions. The employee is responsible for comprehensive technical and administrative management of the planning, estimating, development, design, and construction of assigned new facilities, renovation, alteration, modification work and maintenance, including smaller locally funded projects, large-scale centrally funded nonrecurring maintenance, building service equipment replacements and additions, and minor improvements, as well as delegated large-scale construction projects. The employee plans and carries out the projects by defining objectives; interprets policies promulgated by authorities which are senior to the immediate supervisor and determines their effect on program needs; independently plans, designs, and carries out work to be done; and serves as a technical authority. Employee performs scheduling and layout of operations and inspection and surveillance of materials, methods, and equipment used in construction. Employee plans specific objectives for the program, including required innovations and improvisations. Prepares detailed cost estimates for use in obtaining project funding and bid evaluation. Employee prepares correspondence, technical reports, estimates, fact sheets, status reports, and schedules as required to complete project assignments. Employee consults with contractor personnel to resolve difficult and complex unforeseen problems and latent conditions that develop during construction. Employee researches, analyzes, tests, and evaluates information, unusual circumstances, unconventional issues, conditions, and problems; considering different, incomplete, and often conflicting information and alternatives; and determines efficient, effective, and feasible solutions to meet the project or situation requirements and constraints both during design and construction. Employee prepares sketches or drawings and specifications changes to solve the problem and incorporates these change documents into the contract performance documents.

Education
GS-0808-
Basic Requirements:
Degree: architecture; or related field that included 60 semester hours of course work in architecture or related disciplines of which at least (1) 30 semester hours were in architectural design, and (2) 6 semester hours were in each of the following: structural technology, properties of materials and methods of construction, and environmental control systems.
OR
Combination of education and experience - college-level education, training, and/or technical experience that furnished (1) a thorough knowledge of the arts and sciences underlying professional architecture, and (2) a good understanding, both theoretical and practical, of the architectural principles, methods, and techniques and their applications to the design and construction or improvement of buildings. The adequacy of such background must be demonstrated by at least one of the following:
Related Curriculum: Degree in architectural engineering may be accepted as satisfying in full the basic requirements, provided the completed course work in architectural engineering provided knowledge, skills, and abilities substantially equivalent to those provided in the courses specified in paragraph A. The curriculum for a degree in either architecture or architectural engineering covers function, esthetics, site, structure, economics, mechanical-electrical, and other engineering problems related to the design and construction of buildings primarily (but not exclusively) intended to house human activities. The courses required for a degree in architecture generally place emphasis upon planning, esthetics, and materials and methods of construction, while the courses for an architectural engineering degree place equal or greater weight on the technical engineering aspects such as structural systems, mechanical systems, and the properties of materials. Because of this difference in emphasis, persons with degrees in architecture may have a preference for work assignments that offer greater opportunities for them to express their artistic and creative abilities. As a result, they may be more concerned with planning and design aspects of architecture, and persons with degrees in architectural engineering may be more engaged in aspects emphasizing technical engineering considerations.
Experience: An applicant lacking a degree in architecture must have had l year of experience in an architect's office or in architectural work for each year short of graduation from a program of study in architecture. In the absence of college courses, 5 years of such experience is required.

Are you applying for a promotion? If you are a current GS employee applying for a higher grade than the grade that you currently hold you must provide an SF-50 that shows that you have held the next lower grade for at least one year. Some SF-50s effective within the last 52 weeks will not demonstrate you have held the next lower grade for at least one year (e.g. General Adjustment SF-50 from this year). In many cases, we need to see two (2) SF-50s to determine time-in-grade and eligibility for promotion. If you are a DoD employee, you can obtain a copy of your SF- 50(s) from MyBiz.

Are you claiming membership in any professional organizations, or possession of a license, certificate or credentials? Check the Conditions of Employment section above to see if any are required. If you claim membership, license, certification, or credentials, you must submit a copy of said document in your application package.

Are you using education as a substitute for some or all of the experience requirement? Is there a basic education requirement for this position? Check the Education section above to see what is allowed and what is required. Any claims you make in your resume or assessment questionnaire regarding education or degrees MUST be supported by official or unofficial transcripts or a list of courses, grades earned, completion dates, and quarter and semester hours earned issued from your school. While unofficial transcripts are acceptable for initial application, an official transcript will ultimately be required if you are selected for the position. You may submit a copy your degree(s) if specific coursework does not have to be verified.

Are you a veteran claiming 5-point veterans' preference or claiming sole survivorship preference? You must submit a copy of your latest DD-214 Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (any copy that shows all dates of service, as well as character of service [Honorable, General, etc.] is acceptable) OR a VA letter that shows dates of service or service connected disability AND character of service. If you have more than one DD-214 for multiple periods of active duty service, submit a copy for each period of service. If you were issued a DD-215 to amend aforementioned information on the DD-214 you must submit that too. If you are not sure of your preference eligibility, visit the Department of Labor's website: Veterans' Preference Advisor

Are you a disabled veteran or claiming 10-point veterans' preference?
If you are eligible to claim 10 point veterans preference you must submit a DD-214 Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty as described above for 5-point preference.

You must also provide the applicable supporting documentation of your disability (e.g. disability letter from the VA) as described on Standard Form-15 (SF-15). http://www.opm.gov/forms/pdf_fill/SF15.pdf.

Please Note:
This is an early career position and we are prioritizing resumes from those with less than 3 years work experience.
We value the international community and wish we could hire from anywhere in the world but it just is not feasible with our projects. Our contracts require that all our employees are US citizens.
About us:
WMD is an established small business specializing in the design and manufacture of ultraprecision optical instruments to support a broad range of scientific research around the world and in space. The work is challenging and requires our team members to be able to balance technical, environmental, business, cost, usability, manufacturability, and a myriad of other requirements while creating novel solutions to our customer’s needs. A core competency of our team is the ability to create designs that require no prototypes and that work reliably for years, sometimes decades in their very first incarnation. This may sound daunting, but we have evolved a very supportive and collaborative culture that allows all team members access to the skills, feedback and support of the rest of the company. While we place a high value on technical skills, we also value the individuality and unique experiences and needs of all our team members. Striving for work life balance, care for each other’s well-being and frequently checking in to make sure team members feel supported and valued is a key part of our success and contentment as a team.
About you:
You are passionate about designing, analyzing, creating and understanding every aspect of whatever you work on. You strive to not only understand what works, but WHY it works down to basic physics and how to make it work better. You are pragmatic and able to compromise to achieve a well-balanced design because there are always conflicting requirements. You prefer working from a strong set of basic guiding principles rather than an infinite list of rigid procedures. You are flexible and able to pivot when problems and conflicts arise. You are thorough and work hard to understand your work deeply to create the most effective designs possible. You are emotionally intelligent and patient with yourself, coworkers, and customers because you realize we are all learning and doing the best we can. You strive to always do better in your technical work and your interpersonal interactions. You value growth in yourself and your teammates and strive to lift everyone up.

Our corporate purpose is to Glorify God, be a faithful steward, and have a positive influence on our community.

Friendly, naturally happy with a smile and a good heart with a business mindset. How’s that for starters? Haha.

We do pretty much the same thing as other places, EXCEPT - the pay is really good if you are really good. Also, our Leadership Team is the BEST, and have AMAZING people skills. They VALUE YOU. They treat you with RESPECT and have a PLAN. Also, our team members are HAPPY!
PLUS, YOU GET A FREE MEAL WITH EACH SHIFT, AND EVERY SUNDAY OFF! Also, we get the BEST, I mean BEST CUSTOMERS so it is EASY to impact their lives in a positive way with each transaction.

Due to the current climate and our dining room being closed, this position will include (but is not limited to) taking orders outside with a headset, expediting orders from the store to curbside vehicles and expediting orders to vehicles in the drive-thru.

We are Chick-fil-A in Franklin and we are seriously looking for seriously responsible, seriously positive people… Yes, I’m serious! We are looking forward to meeting you.
